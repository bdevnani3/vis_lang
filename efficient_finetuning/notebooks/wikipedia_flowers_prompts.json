genes , proteases have drawn the attention of biologists to develop a field aimed to identify and quantify their roles in biology . first coined in 2000 by the overall lab in mcquibban et al . , degradomics was described as linking proteases to substrates on a proteome basis . the discoveries of novel roles for proteases and breakthroughs in protease-substrate discovery would be summarized later by dr. carlos lopez-otin and dr. chris overall , introducing degradomics on a system-wide scale . they collated the current and emerging techniques available to describe proteolysis . by drawing attention to how proteolysis serves as an additional irreversible mechanism by which cells could achieve control over biological processes , they outlined the necessity of studying proteases for their functional relevance in processing bioactive molecules . these bioactive molecules play roles in coagulation , complement activation , dna replication , cell-cycle control , cellular proliferation and migration , hemostasis , immunity , and apoptosis . the degradome was broken down into two concepts , the first referring the entire profile of proteases expressed under by a cell , tissue , or organism under defined circumstances . the second definition applies specifically to the full substrate repertoire of a certain protease in a cell , tissue , or organism .\n", "dr. overall 's group would go on to annotate the complete human and mouse protease-inhibitor degradomes in 2003 . as the complexity of proteolytic networks was uncovered , more thorough descriptions of the degradome and ways to study it became necessary . in 2007 , dr. overall updated the field with a review co-authored by dr. carl blobel detailing how advanced methods were revolutionizing protease-substrate discovery . they described the process of linking proteases to their substrates on a step by step process , beginning with biochemical and proteomic discovery , validation using cellular based assays , and progressing to whole organism levels using animal models . more recently , as technology and techniques have advanced , the overall lab and others have continued to direct the field using more powerful and quantitative techniques .\n"], "spear thistle": ["most species are considered weeds , typically by agricultural interests . \" cirsium vulgare \" ( bull thistle , common thistle , or

honey bees , wool-carder bees , and many butterflies . the seeds are eaten by goldfinches , linnets and greenfinches . the seeds are dispersed by wind , mud , water , and possibly also by ants ; they do not show significant long-term dormancy , most germinating soon after dispersal and only a few lasting up to four years in the soil seed bank . seed is also often spread by human activity such as hay bales .\n", "spear thistle is designated an \" injurious weed \" under the uk weeds act 1959 , and a noxious weed in australia and in nine us states . spread is only by seed , not by root fragments as in the related creeping thistle \" c. arvense . \" it is best cleared from land by hoeing and deep cutting of the taproot before seeds mature ; regular cultivation also prevents its establishment .\n", "conservation issues include the danger of fire , some erosion prone areas near the coast , overgrazing and the presence of feral cats , mice , rats and rabbits . clearance of these introduced species is unlikely in the near future because of the size of the island and the varied geography . spear thistle , accidentally introduced to the island , is a problem ; volunteers

about half the length of its body . its pelage is dense and heavy , and colouration varies between shades of orange and brown with white ventral areas and distinctive vertical black stripes that are unique in each individual . stripes are likely advantageous for camouflage in vegetation such as long grass with strong vertical patterns of light and shade . the tiger is one of only a few striped cat species ; it is not known why spotted patterns and rosettes are the more common camouflage pattern among felids . the orangish colour may also aid in camouflage as the tiger 's prey are dichromats , and thus may perceive the cat as green and blended in with the vegetation . a tiger 's coat pattern is still visible when it is shaved . this is not due to skin pigmentation , but to the stubble and hair follicles embedded in the skin , similar to human beards ( colloquially ) , and is in common with other big cats . they have a mane-like heavy growth of fur around the neck and jaws and long

areas adjacent to the larger creeks , bayous , and rivers which overflow and flood with some regularity . the floodwaters deposit rich alluvial soils , moderately permeable silty , sandy loams that support a wide diversity of vegetation . the major floodplains in the region were formed during the wisconsin glaciation , when sea levels were low and great rivers cut deep and wide channels in the landscape . these channels are now largely filled with sediment and deposits through which the present day rives , much smaller than in the past , wind and meander . floodplains often occur in terraces with various swales , ridges , and levees stepping down in tiers to the water level . some ecologist subdivide these terraces into separate ecosystems , including but not limited to , baygalls on the outer margins of higher terraces , and cypress sloughs in the lowest areas . pine trees are uncommon or absent in the floodplains , which are dominated by deciduous canopy trees including water oak ( \" quercus nigra \" ) , chestneu or basket oak ( \" quercus michauxii \" ) , willow oak ( \" quercus phellos \" ) , cherrybark oak ( \" quercus pagoda \" ) , and red oak ( \" quercus falcata \" ) . other important trees include the overcup oak ( \" quercus lyrata \" ) which can grow in and around standing water , sweetgum ( \" liquidambar styraciflua \" ) , blackgum ( \" nyssa sylvatica \" ) , water hickory ( \" carya aquatica \" ) , and red maple ( \" acer rubrum \" ) , often with a dense mid-story of ironwood ( \" carpinus caroliniana \" ) . among the many wildflowers are three irises , yellow iris ( \" iris pseudacorus \" ) , southern iris ( \" iris virginica \" ) , and short-stem iris ( \" iris brevicaulis \" ) , as well as the fragrant ladies tresses orchid ( \" spiranthes odorata \" ) , blue jasmine ( \" clematis crispa \" ) , and the aquatic spatterdock ( \" nuphar luteum \" ) . although the floodplains in the region share much in common with one another , each river varies with some unique elements and plant species . the trinity river basin in particular stands out in contrast to others with calcareous , relatively high ph , alkaline soils supporting vegetation that is seldom seen in other watersheds , including bois d 'arc also called horse apple ( \" maclura pomifera \" ) , blueberry hawthorn ( \" crataegus brachyacantha \" ) ,

wildlife , often of species adapted to open woodland . after cutting , the increased light allows existing woodland-floor vegetation such as bluebell , anemone and primrose to grow vigorously . often brambles grow around the stools , encouraging insects , or various small mammals that can use the brambles as protection from larger predators . woodpiles ( if left in the coppice ) encourage insects such as beetles to come into an area . the open area is then colonised by many animals such as nightingale , european nightjar and fritillary butterflies . as the coup grows , the canopy closes and it becomes unsuitable for these animals againbut in an actively managed coppice there is always another recently cut coup nearby , and the populations therefore move around , following the coppice

, was associated with the pollen of several flowers that may have been in bloom at the time of deposition - yarrow , centaury , ragwort , grape hyacinth , joint pine , and hollyhock . the medicinal properties of the plants led american archaeologist ralph solecki to claim that the man buried was some leader , healer , or shaman , and that \" the association of flowers with neanderthals adds a

birdeye speedway . furthermore , bulb plants , also called geophytes , grow between the vines . firmly rooted in the ground they survive the intense cultivation of the vineyard . they are largely of mediterranean origin . special mention should be made of the very common grape hyacinth and wild garlic , from which this community of herbs derives its name . less frequent are the hairy star of

annianus around the year ad 400 , placing the annunciation on 25 march ad 9 ( julian ) - eight to ten years after the date that dionysius was to imply . although this incarnation was popular during the early centuries of the byzantine empire , years numbered from it , an \" era of incarnation , \" were exclusively used and are still used in ethiopia . this accounts for the seven- or eight-year discrepancy between the gregorian and ethiopian calendars . byzantine chroniclers like maximus the confessor , george syncellus , and theophanes dated their years from annianus ' creation of the world . this era , called \" anno mundi , \" \" year of the world \" ( abbreviated am ) , by modern scholars , began its first year on 25 march 5492 bc . later byzantine chroniclers used \" anno mundi \"

called from berroc wood , where the box tree grows very abundantly ) . \" this date has been accepted by the editors of asser 's biography , simon keynes and michael lapidge , and by other historians such as david dumville and richard huscroft . however , west saxon genealogical lists state that alfred was 23 when he became king in april 871 , implying that he was born between april 847 and april 848 . this dating is adopted in the biography of alfred by alfred smyth , who regards asser 's biography as fraudulent , an allegation which is rejected by other historians . richard abels in his biography discusses both sources but does not decide between them and dates alfred 's birth as 847 / 849 , while patrick wormald in his \" oxford dictionary of national biography \" article dates it 848 / 849 . berkshire had been historically disputed between wessex and mercia , and as late as 844 , a charter showed that it was part of mercia , but alfred 's birth in the county is evidence that ,

. the credit for this nickname should go to the maurists , as rene hoven has shown . the name has remained with the unknown author . attempts to identify this ambrosiaster with known authors has continued , but with no success . because augustine cites ambrosiaster 's commentary on romans 5.12 under the name of \" hilary , \" many critics have attempted to identify ambroasiaster with one of the many writers named \" hilary \" active in the period . in 1899 , germain morin suggested that the writer was isaac , a converted jew and writer of a tract on the trinity and incarnation , who was exiled to spain in 378-380 and then relapsed to judaism ; but he afterwards abandoned this theory of the authorship in favour of decimus hilarianus hilarius , proconsul of africa in 377 . alternatively , paolo angelo ballerini attempted to sustain the traditional attribution of the work to ambrose , in his complete edition of that father 's work . this is extremely problematic , though , since it would require ambrose to have written the book before he became a bishop , and then added to it in later years , incorporating later remarks of hilary of poitiers on romans . no

errors . belgian sociologist and statistician adolphe quetelet discovered that its extremely wide applicability in his analysis of vast amounts of statistics of human physical characteristics such as height and other traits such as criminality and alcoholism . queletet derived the concept of the \" average man \" from his studies . sir francis galton employed quetelet 's ideas in his research on mathematical biology . in his experiments with sweet peas in the 1870s , galton discovered that the spread of the distributions of a particular trait did not change over the generations . he invented what he called the \" quincunx \" to demonstrate why mixtures of normal distributions were normal . galton noticed that the means of a particular trait in the offspring generation differed from those of the parent generation , a phenomenon now known as regression to the mean . he found that the slopes of the regression lines of two given variables were the same if the two data sets were scaled by units of probable error and introduced the notion of the correlation coefficient , but noted that correlation does not imply causation .\n", "galton 's development of the law of regression to the mean , or reversion , was due to insights from the quincunx ( ' bean machine ' ) and his studies of sweet peas . while galton had previously invented the quincunx prior to february 1874 , the 1877 version of the quincunx had a new feature that helped galton demonstrate that a normal mixture of normal distributions is also normal . galton demonstrated this using a new version of quincunx , adding chutes to the apparatus to represent reversion . when the pellets passed through the curved chutes ( representing reversion ) and then the pins ( representing family variability ) , the result was a stable population . on friday 19 february 1877 galton gave a lecture entitled \" typical laws of heredity \" at the royal institution in london . in this lecture , he posited that there must be a counteracting force to maintain population stability . however , this model required a much larger degree of intergenerational natural selection than was plausible .\n", "in 1875 , galton started growing sweet peas , and addressed the royal institution on his findings on 9 february 1877 . he found that each group of progeny seeds followed a normal curve , and the curves were equally disperse . each group was not centered about the parent 's weight , but rather at a weight closer to the population average . galton called this reversion , as every progeny group was distributed at a value that was closer to the population average than the parent . the deviation from the population average was in the same direction , but the magnitude of the deviation was only one-third as large . in doing so , galton demonstrated that there was variability among each of the families , yet the families combined to produce a stable , normally distributed population . when galton addressed the british association for the advancement of science in 1885 , he said of his investigation of sweet peas , \" i was then blind to what i now perceive to be the simple explanation of the phenomenon . \"\n", "after the conclusion of the international health exhibition , galton used these data to confirm in humans his theory of linear regression , posed after studying sweet peas . the accumulation of this human data allowed him to observe the correlation between forearm length and height , head width and head breadth , and head length and height . with these observations he was able to write \" co-relations and their measurements , chiefly from anthropometric data . \" in this publication , galton defined what co-relation as a phenomenon that occurs when \" the variation of the one [ variable ] is accompanied on the average by more or less variation of the other , and in the same direction . \"\n", "galton was the first to describe and explain the common phenomenon of regression

thought deadly . in 1970 the us food and drug administration published a newsletter stating erroneously that \" one poinsettia leaf can kill a child , \" and in 1980 they were prohibited from nursing homes in a county in north carolina due to this supposed toxicity .\n", "an attempt to determine a poisonous dose of poinsettia to rats failed , even after reaching experimental doses equivalent to consuming 500 leaves , or nearly of sap . contact with any part of the plant by children or pets often has no effect , though it may cause nausea , diarrhea , or vomiting if swallowed . external exposure to the plant may result in a skin rash for some . a survey of more than 20,000 calls to the american association of poison control centers from 1985-1992 related to poinsettia exposure showed no fatalities . in 92.4 % of calls , there was no effect from exposure , and in 3.4 % of calls there were minor effects , defined as \" minimally bothersome . \" similarly , a cat or dog 's exposure to poinsettias rarely necessitates medical treatment . if ingested , mild drooling or vomiting can occur , or rarely , diarrhea . in rare cases , exposure to the eye may result in eye irritation . skin exposure to the sap may cause itchiness , redness , or swelling .\n", "the poinsettia occurs in central america , occurring from mexico to southern guatemala . its range is about long , encompassing mid-elevation tropical dry forests . most wild populations are on pacific-facing slopes in steep canyons . populations were once found in rolling hill areas , though many have gone extinct . it has been hypothesized that the inaccessibility of the canyons may protect the wild populations from human disturbance . there is a somewhat anomalous population of wild poinsettias in the northern part of the mexican state of guerrero and oaxaca , which is much further inland in the hot and seasonally dry forests than the rest of the species ' range . genetic analyses showed that the wild populations in northern guerrero are the likely ancestors of most cultivated poinsettias .\n", "the tropical dry forests where wild poinsettias grow experience largely unregulated deforestation , resulting in habitat loss . its natural habitat is thus highly fragmented , particularly near metropolitan areas such as taxco . population sizes are frequently very small , with as few as a dozen individuals . populations can be up to several hundred individuals , but this is not typical . a conservation risk typical for species with wild and cultivated populations is the contamination of the wild gene pool by hybridization with cultivated individuals . this has not been documented in wild poinsettias though , as cultivars seldom flower and do not produce fruits . as of 2012 , wild poinsettias are not protected by mexican law .\n", "the plant 's association with christmas began in 16th-century mexico , where legend tells of a girl , commonly called pepita or maria , who was too poor to provide a gift for the celebration of jesus ' birthday and was inspired by an angel to gather weeds from the roadside and place them in front of the church altar . crimson blossoms sprouted from the weeds and became poinsettias . from the 17th century , franciscan friars in mexico included the plants in their christmas celebrations . the star-shaped leaf pattern is said to symbolize the star of bethlehem , and the red color represents the blood sacrifice of jesus 's crucifixion .\n", "poinsettias are popular christmas decorations in homes , churches , offices , and elsewhere across north america , as a result of an extensive marketing campaign by the ecke family that began by shipping free poinsettias to television stations for use on-air . in the us , december 12 is national poinsettia day , marking the anniversary of joel roberts poinsett 's death .\n", "the aztecs were the first to cultivate poinsettias . cultivation in the us began when diplomat joel roberts poinsett sent some of the plants back to his greenhouses in south carolina in the 1820s . specific details about its spread from there are largely unverifiable , but it was exhibited at the pennsylvania horticultural society in 1829 by colonel robert carr .\n", "the poinsettia is the world 's most economically important potted plant . each year in the us , approximately 70 million poinsettias are sold in a period of six weeks , at a value of us $ 250 million . in puerto rico , where poinsettias are grown extensively in greenhouses , the industry is valued at $ 5 million annually . there are over 100 cultivated varieties of poinsettia that have been patented in the us .\n", "until the 1990s , the ecke family , who had moved their operation to encinitas , california , in 1923 , had a virtual monopoly on poinsettias owing to a technique that made their plants much more attractive . they produced a fuller , more compact plant by grafting two varieties of poinsettia together . a poinsettia left to grow on its own will naturally take an open , somewhat weedy look . the eckes ' technique made it possible to get every seedling to branch , resulting in a bushier plant .\n", "poinsettias are susceptible to several diseases , mostly fungal , but also bacterial and parasitic . conditions that promote poinsettia propagation also favor certain diseases . fungal diseases affecting greenhouse poinsettia operations include \" pythium \" root rot , \" rhizoctonia \" root and stem rot , black root rot , scab , powdery mildew , and \" botrytis \" blight . bacterial diseases include bacterial soft rot and bacterial canker , while a viral disease is \" poinsettia mosaic virus . \" infection by poinsettia branch-inducing phytoplasma is actually desirable , as it keeps the plants shorter with more flowers . it is the first known phytoplasma that has economically advantageous effects .\n", "a variety of imaginative associations have been made by idle beachcombers who run across the bleached skeletons of dead sand dollars . they are sometimes said to represent coins lost by mermaids or the people of atlantis . christian missionaries found symbolism in the fivefold radial pattern and dove-shaped internal structures , and a card with an anonymous poem explaining the legend is often given in conjunction with the sale of a sand dollar by merchants . the story compares the holes with the crucifixion wounds of christ , and other features with the star of bethlehem , an easter lily , a poinsettia , and doves .\n", "individuals may play the various parts of mary ( maria ) and joseph ( jose ) , with the expectant mother riding a real donkey , attendants such as angels and shepherds joining along the way , or pilgrims who may carry images of the holy personages instead , while children may carry poinsettias . the procession is followed by musicians , with the entire procession singing posadas such as pedir posada . at the end of each night , christmas carols are sung , children break open star-shaped pinatas and everyone sits for a feast . the pinatas used during the holiday are traditionally made out of clay .\n", "another important cash and export crop is fresh flowers and ornamental plants . in 2003 , this sector accounted for 27 million dollars of income to the state , up from 20 million in 2000 . morelos is mexico 's major producers of roses , producing 54,552 dozens in 2002 . morelos claims to be the native location of the poinsettia , called \" noche buena \" in spanish . it is native to mexico , but there has been a \" diplomatic patent \" on the plant since the early 19th century when the first us ambassador to mexico , joel roberts poinsett , registered it . the state 's historical society has asked the secretary of the interior to review treaties and work to have this patent annulled . as it stands now , mexican poinsettia growers must pay royalty fees to the u.s. and even import cuttings from authorized growers in the u.s. to grow the plant commercially . another effort to combat the patent is to develop a new variety of the flower that would not be covered .\n", "for the 2010 fiesta bowl , the selections of tcu and boise state caused a great deal of controversy . for the first and only time in the bcs era , two bcs non-aq teams were chosen to play in bcs bowls in the same bowl season : however , they ended up facing each other in this bowl . because both non-aq teams were placed in the same bowl game , the bowl was derisively referred to as the \" separate but equal bowl , \" the \" quarantine bowl , \" the \" fiasco bowl , \" the \" bcs kids ' table , \" etc . some had called for a boycott because of this arrangement . there was wide speculation that the bcs bowl selection committees maneuvered tcu and boise state into the same bowl so as to deny them the chances to \" embarrass \" two aq conference representatives in separate bowls , as boise state had done in the 2007 fiesta bowl and utah had done in the 2005 fiesta bowl and 2009 sugar bowl ( prior to the game , non-aq teams were 3-1 versus aq teams in bcs bowls ) . in response , fiesta bowl ceo john junker called those allegations \" the biggest load of crap that i 've ever heard in my life \" and said that \" we 're in the business of doing things that are on behalf of our bowl game and we don 't do the bidding of someone else to our detriment . \" beyond the unappealing nature of a \" david vs. david \" contest which resulted from this pairing in a major bowl , the appeal was further diminished due

into the u.s. army . he quickly secured a place attached to a public relations unit near syracuse , and set about obtaining a place on one of the coaching staff for the military 's football teams . general stanley scott of fort belvoir , virginia , obtained davis 's services in 1953 as football coach for his post 's football squad . at the time , military football was taken very seriously ; the teams were well-stocked with drafted college stars , and often scrimmaged national football league ( nfl ) teams . davis coached fort belvoir , just south of washington , d.c. , to a record of eight wins , two losses , and one tie ( 8-2-1 ) , missing a chance to play in the poinsettia bowl in san diego because of a final-game loss to the nearby quantico marine base . near the end of 1952 , he was called to testify before a congressional committee investigating whether athletes were being coddled in the military . although most of davis 's team was sent to korea , he remained at fort belvoir until his discharge in 1954 . while coaching in the army , davis sold scouting information about his players to nfl teams . one nfl executive who contacted davis was pete rozelle of the los angeles

biodiverse locations for reptilian species such as florida , a very low volume of such prey are reportedly taken by cooper 's hawks . in arkansas , a small sample of road-killed cooper 's hawks showed that small reptiles were more common than birds amongst the stomach contents , with bougainville 's skinks ( \" lerista bougainvillii \" ) and ring-necked snakes ( \" diadophis punctatus \" ) constituting about 40 % of the diet . strong detection of reptilian prey is known in more western locations , especially farther south . in fact , of avian predators in one californian study 's estimation , the cooper 's hawks showed the most reliance on lizards locally , but that the cooper 's was not locally common in the study area so had relatively limited impact . in california , it was found that 69 % of the diet was reptiles , most of which were assorted lizards ( led by whiptail lizards , nearly of which were estimated to be found in one nest ) . in rural areas outside of tucson , a fairly strong presence of ( unidentified to species ) spiny lizards , at 13 % of 77 prey items , although overall in all areas of the tucson metropolitan , reptiles constituted a lower 8 % of the total 228 prey items . in durango , reptiles were a pronounced part of the cooper 's hawk diet . here , the most frequently identified prey species was the mexican plateau horned lizard ( \" phrynosoma orbiculare \" ) ( 11.5 % of 191 prey items ) , followed by the northern flicker and thirdly the crevice spiny lizard ( \" sceloporus poinsettia \" ) ( 10.47 % , plus other unidentified spiny lizards making up a further 4.2 % of the diet ) . in arizona , spiny lizards were similarly detected to have a strong prey-predator relationship with cooper 's hawks as well . most lizards encountered and hunted by cooper 's hawks are fairly small but , despite being more scarcely selected , snake prey may show greater size variation . snakes known to be taken have ranged in size from the redbelly snake ( \" storeria occipitomaculata \" ) to the a young black rat snake ( \" pantherophis obsoletus \" ) , estimated to weigh , and the gopher snake ( \" pituophis catenifer \" ) ( adults of the latter two snake species can average roughly for both species and may be too formidable for these hawks ) . unlike with reptiles , there is little evidence that the cooper 's hawk regularly hunts amphibians in any area , despite a few species being known in the prey spectrum . while some authors have posited that as much as 2.1 % of the cooper 's hawks global prey consists of invertebrates , prevailing food studies tend to find scant to none evidence of such prey . ; however , a truly exceptional case of cooper 's hawks found dead in arkansas showed that beetles and moths

( see figure . ) her charts clearly showed that most deaths resulted from disease , which led the general public to demand improved sanitation at field hospitals . although bar charts representing frequencies were first used by the frenchman a. m. guerry in 1833 , it was the statistician karl pearson who gave them the name \" histograms . \" pearson used them in an 1895 article mathematically analyzing biological evolution . one such histogram showed that buttercups with large numbers of petals were rarer .\n", "yellow is the color between orange and green on the spectrum of visible light . it is evoked by light with a dominant wavelength of roughly 570590 nm . it is a primary color in subtractive color systems , used in painting or color printing . in the rgb color model , used to create colors on television and computer screens , yellow is a secondary color made by combining red and green at equal intensity . carotenoids give the characteristic yellow color to autumn leaves , corn , canaries , daffodils , and lemons , as well as egg yolks , buttercups , and bananas . they absorb light energy and protect plants from photodamage in some cases . sunlight has a slight yellowish hue when the sun is near the horizon , due to atmospheric scattering of shorter wavelengths ( green , blue , and violet ) .\n", "carotenoids are common in many living things ; they give the characteristic color to carrots , maize , daffodils , rutabagas , buttercups and bananas . they are responsible for the red of cooked lobsters , the pink of flamingoes and salmon and the yellow of canaries and egg yolks .\n", "while \" pinafore \" was running strongly at the opera comique in london , gilbert was eager to get started on his and sullivan 's next opera , and he began working on the libretto in december 1878 . he re-used several elements of his 1870 one-act piece , \" our island home , \" which had introduced a pirate \" chief , \" captain bang . bang was mistakenly apprenticed to a pirate band as a child by his deaf nursemaid . also , bang , like frederic in \" the pirates of penzance , \" had never seen a woman before and felt a keen sense of duty , as an apprenticed pirate , until the passage of his twenty-first birthday freed him from his articles of indenture . bernard shaw believed that gilbert drew on ideas in \" les brigands \" for his new libretto , including the businesslike bandits and the bumbling police . gilbert and sullivan also inserted into act ii an idea they first considered for a one-act opera parody in 1876 about burglars meeting police , while their conflict escapes the notice of the oblivious father of a large family of girls . as in \" pinafore , \" \" there was a wordful self-descriptive set-piece for stanley [ \" the major-general 's song \" ] , introducing himself much as sir joseph porter had done ... a lugubrious comic number for the sergeant of police ... a song of confession for ruth , the successor [ to ] little buttercup , \" romantic material for frederic and mabel , and \" ensemble and chorus music in turn pretty , parodic and atmospheric . \"\n", "in november 1879 , gilbert , sullivan and carte sailed to america with a company of strong singers , to play both \" pinafore \" and the new opera , including j. h. ryley as sir joseph , blanche roosevelt as josephine , alice barnett as little buttercup , furneaux cook as dick deadeye , hugh talbot as ralph rackstraw and jessie bond as cousin hebe , some of whom had been in the \" pinafore \" cast in london . to these , he added some american singers , including signor brocolini as captain corcoran . alfred cellier came to assist sullivan , while his brother francois remained in london to conduct \" pinafore \" there . gilbert and sullivan chose talented actors who were not well-known stars , and so they did not command high fees . they then tailored their operas to the particular abilities of these performers . the skill with which gilbert and sullivan used their performers had an effect on the audience : as critic herman klein wrote , \" we secretly marvelled at the naturalness and ease with which [ the gilbertian quips and absurdities ] were said and done . for until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird , eccentric , yet intensely human beings ... [ they ] conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight . \" gilbert acted as stage director for his own plays and operas . he sought naturalism in acting , which was unusual at the time , just as he strove for realistic visual elements . he deprecated self-conscious interaction with the audience and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes . sullivan conducted the music rehearsals .\n", "the success of \" the sorcerer \" paved the way for another collaboration by gilbert and sullivan . carte agreed on terms for a new opera with the comedy opera company , and gilbert began work on \" h.m.s. pinafore \" before the end of 1877 . gilbert 's father had been a naval surgeon , and the nautical theme of the opera appealed to him . he drew on several of his earlier \" bab ballad \" poems ( many of which also have nautical themes ) , including \" captain reece \" ( 1868 ) and \" general john \" ( 1867 ) . some of the characters also have prototypes in the ballads : dick deadeye is based on a character in \" woman 's gratitude \" ( 1869 ) ; an early version of ralph rackstraw can be seen in \" joe go-lightly \" ( 1867 ) , with its sailor madly in love with the daughter of someone who far outranks him ; and little buttercup is taken almost wholesale from \" the bumboat woman 's story \" ( 1870 ) . on 27 december 1877 , while sullivan was on holiday on the french riviera , gilbert sent him a plot sketch accompanied by the following note :\n", "in \" pinafore , \" gilbert , sullivan and carte used several of the principal cast members whom they had assembled for \" the sorcerer . \" as gilbert had suggested to sullivan in december 1877 , \" mrs. cripps [ little buttercup ] will be a capital part for everard ... barrington will be a capital captain , and grossmith a first-rate first lord . \" however , mrs howard paul , who had played lady sangazure in \" the sorcerer , \" was declining vocally . she was under contract to play the role of cousin hebe in \" pinafore . \" gilbert made an effort to write an amusing part for her despite sullivan 's reluctance to use her , but by mid-may 1878 , both gilbert and sullivan wanted her out of the cast ; unhappy with the role , she left . with only a week to go before opening night , carte hired a concert singer , jessie bond , to play cousin hebe . since bond had little experience as an actress , gilbert and sullivan cut the dialogue out of the role , except for a few lines in the last scene , which they turned into recitative . other new cast members were emma howson and george power in the romantic roles , who were improvements on the romantic soprano and tenor in \" the sorcerer . \"\n", "little buttercup , a portsmouth \" bumboat woman \" ( dockside vendor ) - who is the \" rosiest , roundest , and reddest beauty in all spithead \" - comes on board to sell her wares to the crew . she hints that she may be hiding a dark secret under her \" gay and frivolous exterior . \" ralph rackstraw , \" the smartest lad in all the fleet , \" enters , declaring his love for the captain 's daughter , josephine . his fellow sailors ( excepting dick deadeye , the grim and ugly realist of the crew ) offer their sympathies , but they can give ralph little hope that his love will ever be returned .\n", "the gentlemanly and popular captain corcoran greets his \" gallant crew \" and compliments them on their politeness , saying that he returns the favour by never ( \" well , hardly ever \" ) using bad language , such as \" a big , big d. \" after the sailors leave , the captain confesses to little buttercup that josephine is reluctant to consider a marriage proposal from sir joseph porter , the first lord of the admiralty . buttercup says that she knows how it feels to love in vain . as she leaves , the captain remarks that she is \" a plump and pleasing person . \" josephine enters and reveals to her father that she loves a humble sailor in his crew , but she assures him that she is a dutiful daughter and will never reveal her love to this sailor .\n", "later that night , under a full moon , captain corcoran reviews his concerns : his \" kindly crew rebels , \" his \" daughter to a tar is partial , \" his friends seem to desert him , and sir joseph has threatened a court-martial . little buttercup offers sympathy . he tells her that , if it were not for the difference in their social standing , he would have returned her affection . she prophesies that things are not all as they seem and that \" a change \" is in store for him , but he does not understand her cryptic warning .\n", "when sir joseph asks what had provoked the usually polite officer 's outburst , ralph replies that it was his declaration of love for josephine . furious in his turn at this revelation , and ignoring josephine 's plea to spare ralph , sir joseph has the sailor \" loaded with chains \" and taken to the ship 's brig . little buttercup now comes forward to reveal her long-held secret . many years ago , when she \" practised baby-farming , \" she had cared for two babies , one \" of low condition , \" the other \" a regular patrician . \" she confesses that she \" mixed those children up . ... the wellborn babe was ralph ;

in madrid , ottawa and melbourne ; even in paris , rome , vienna and berlin . \" after the deaths of gilbert and sullivan , the d 'oyly carte opera company retained exclusive rights to perform their operas in great britain until 1962 , touring throughout britain for most of the year and , beginning in 1919 , often performing in london for a season of about four months . \" the times \" gave the company 's 1920 london production an enthusiastic review , saying that the audience was \" enraptured , \" and regretting that \" pinafore \" would be played for only two weeks . it praised the cast , singling out leo sheffield as the captain , henry lytton as sir joseph , elsie griffin as josephine , james hay as ralph , bertha lewis as little buttercup and the \" splendid \" choral tone . it concluded that the opera made a \" rollicking climax to the season . \" two years later , it gave an even more glowing report of that season 's performances , calling derek oldham an \" ideal hero \" as ralph , noting that sydney granville \" fairly brought down the house \" with his song , that darrell fancourt 's deadeye was \" an admirably sustained piece of caricature \" and that it was a \" great pleasure \" to hear the returning principals . a 1961 review of the company 's \" pinafore \" is much the same .\n", "in the u.s. , where gilbert and sullivan 's performance copyright was never in force , \" pinafore \" continued to be produced continuously by both professional and amateur companies . \" the new york times , \" in a 1914 review , called a large-scale production at the 6,000-seat new york hippodrome a \" royal entertainment [ that ] comes up smiling . \" the opera had been turned into a \" mammoth spectacle \" with a chorus of hundreds and the famous hippodrome tank providing a realistic harbour . buttercup made her entrance by rowing over to the three-masted \" pinafore , \" and dick deadeye was later thrown overboard with a real splash . the \" times \" praised the hearty singing but noted that some subtlety is lost when the dialogue needs to be \" shouted . \" the production took some liberties , including interpolated music from other sullivan works . the paper concluded , \" the mild satire of \" pinafore \" is entertaining because it is universal . \" the same newspaper deemed winthrop ames ' popular broadway productions of \" pinafore \" in the 1920s and 1930s \" spectacular . \" modern productions in america continue to be generally well received . \" the new york times \" review of the new york gilbert and sullivan players ' 2008 season at new york city center commented , \" gilbert 's themes of class inequality , overbearing nationalism and incompetent authorities remain relevant , however absurdly treated . but the lasting appeal of \" pinafore \" and its ilk is more a matter of his unmatched linguistic genius and sullivan 's generous supply of addictive melodies . \"\n", "a theme that pervades the opera is the treatment of love across different social ranks . in the previous gilbert and sullivan opera , \" the sorcerer , \" a love potion causes trouble by inducing the villagers and wedding guests to fall in love with people of different social classes . in \" pinafore , \" the captain 's daughter , josephine , loves and is loved by a common sailor , but she dutifully tells him , \" your proffered love i haughtily reject . \" he expresses his devotion to her in a poetic and moving speech that ends with \" i am a british sailor , and i love you . \" it finally turns out that he is of a higher rank than she . this is a parody of the victorian \" equality \" drama , such as lord lytton 's \" the lady of lyons \" ( 1838 ) , where the heroine rejects a virtuous peasant who makes a similarly moving speech , ending with \" i am a peasant ! \" it then turns out that he has become her social superior . furthermore , in \" pinafore , \" sir joseph assures josephine that \" love levels all ranks . \" in tom taylor 's \" the serf , \" the heroine again loves a worthy peasant who turns out to be of high rank , and she declares happily at the end that \" love levels all . \" in a satire of the libertarian traditions of nautical melodrama , sir joseph tells the crew of the pinafore that they are \" any man 's equal \" ( excepting his ) , and he writes a song for them that glorifies the british sailor . conversely , he brings the proud captain down a notch by making him \" dance a hornpipe on the cabin table . \" jones notes that the union between ralph and josephine \" becomes acceptable only through the absurd second-act revelation of buttercup 's inadvertent switching of the infants \" and concludes that gilbert is a \" conservative satirist [ who ] ultimately advocated preserving the status quo ... [ and ] set out to show [ that ] love definitely \" does not \" level all ranks . \"\n", "the best-known songs from the opera include \" i 'm called little buttercup , \" a waltz tune introducing the character , which sullivan repeats in the entr 'acte and in the act ii finale to imprint the melody on the mind of the audience ; and \" a british tar \" ( a glee for three men describing the ideal sailor ) , composed by sir joseph \" to encourage independent thought and action in the lower branches of the service , and to teach the principle that a british sailor is any man 's equal , excepting mine . \" sullivan 's voicing advances the satiric lyric , which mocks the \" equality \" plays while underlining the hypocrisy of sir joseph . another popular number is sir joseph 's song \" when i was a lad , \" recounting the meteoric rise of his career , which bears similarities to that of w. h. smith , the civilian news entrepreneur who had risen to the position of first lord of the admiralty in 1877 .\n", "in \" pinafore , \" sullivan exploits minor keys for comic effect , for instance in \" kind captain , i 've important information . \" further , he achieves a musical surprise when he uses the subdominant minor in \" sorry her lot . \" the musicologist gervase hughes was impressed with the introduction to the opening chorus which includes \" a rousing nautical tune ... in a key of no nonsense , c major ... a modulation to the mediant minor , where to our surprise a plaintive oboe gives us the first verse of \" sorry her lot \" in 2 / 4 [ time ] . after this closes on the local dominant b major the violins ( still in 2 / 4 ) introduce us to little buttercup ... meeting her under these conditions one would hardly expect her to blossom out later as a queen of the waltz . \" he continues , \" the bassoon and basses ... assert vigorously who is the captain of the pinafore ... in the improbable key of a flat minor . ... buttercup makes a last despairing attempt to make herself heard in d flat minor , but the others have never known that such an outlandish key existed . so in a flash they all go back to c major on a good old 6 / 4 . \"\n", "according to jacobs , \" ralph , captain corcoran , sir joseph and josephine all live in their interactive music ( particularly ' never mind the why and wherefore ' ) , and almost as much musical resource is lavished on two characters parodied from opera or melodrama , little buttercup with ' gypsy blood in her veins ' and the heavy-treading dick deadeye . \" jacobs also opined that the leading tone that begins \" never mind the why and wherefore \" \" serves to emphasize the phrase like a johann strauss-ian grace-note . \" the sullivan scholar david russell hulme noted sullivan 's parody of operatic styles , \" particularly the handelian recitatives and the elopement scene ( evocative of so many nocturnal operatic conspiracies ) , but best of all is the travesty of the patriotic tune in ' for he is an englishman ! ' \" buttercup 's act ii song , in which she reveals the dark secret of the baby-switching is preceded by a quote from franz schubert 's \" the erl-king \" and also parodies the opera \" il trovatore . \" jacobs notes that sullivan also adds his own humorous touches to the music by setting commonplace expressions in \" donizettian recitative . \" but on the serious side , he enhances the moments of true emotional climax , as in josephine 's act ii aria , and added musical interest to concerted numbers by \" subtly shifting the rhythms and bar groupings . \"\n", "the opera 's popularity has led to the widespread parody and pastiche of its songs in comedy routines , literature and other media . many comedians have used \" pinafore \" songs for comic and satiric effect . for example , in his comedy album \" my son , the celebrity , \" allan sherman parodies \" when i was a lad \" from the point of view of a young man who goes to an ivy league school and then rises to prominence in business . at the end of the song , he \" thanks old yale , \" \" thanks the lord \" and thanks his father , \" who is chairman of the board . \" literary references to \" pinafore \" songs include harris 's attempt to sing \" when i was a lad \" in jerome k. jerome 's \" three men in a boat . \" another is found in the story \" runaround \" from \" i , robot \" by isaac asimov , where a robot sings part of \" i 'm called little buttercup . \" \" pinafore \" and its songs have been performed by rock musicians such as todd rundgren , taj mahal and michele gray rundgren , who performed \" never mind the why and wherefore \" on \" night music \" ( \" sunday night \" ) in 1989 .\n", "characters also sing songs from \" pinafore \" in such popular films as \" raiders of the lost ark \" ( 1981 ) and \" \" ( 1998 ) , where captain picard and lt. commander worf sing part of \" a british tar \" to distract a malfunctioning lt. commander data . \" the good shepherd \" ( 2006 ) depicts an all-male version of \" pinafore \" at yale university in 1939 ; matt damons character plays little buttercup , singing in falsetto . judy garland sings \" i am the monarch of the sea \" in the 1963 film , \" i could go on singing . \" the soundtrack of the 1992 thriller \" the hand that rocks the cradle \" prominently features songs and music from \" pinafore , \" and the father and daughter characters sing \" i am the captain of the pinafore \" together . an example of a film based on ideas from \" pinafore \" is the 1976 animated film by ronald searle called \" dick deadeye , or duty done \" is based on the character and songs from \" pinafore . \" in the 1988 drama \" permanent record , \" a high school class performs \" pinafore . \"\n", "in the fourth series he is a persistent

girls have to deal with the normal issues that young children face , such as sibling rivalries , loose teeth , personal hygiene , going to school , bed wetting , or dependence on a security blanket .

nectar , meaning that they are important pollinators in their native range as well as important agents of decomposition . the pollen ( which the flies are capable of digesting , perhaps with the assistance of bacteria in their digestive tracts ) may be used as an alternative protein source , especially for gravid females who need large amounts of protein and cannot reliably find carrion . notably , gravid flies are particularly attracted to sapromyophilous flowers that exude a carrion-like odor , such as the dead horse arum lily . these flowers are tricking the flies into pollinating them by mimicking the scent of a corpse . however , the flies also frequently visit myophilous flowers such as the oxeye daisy , and are attracted to the color yellow as well as to the scent of flowers . this indicates that the flies are attracted to flowers not only because they smell like carrion ( in the case of the arum lily ) , but specifically for the pollen offered by the flower ( in

or during gamete formation . an allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species . both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally , but may be unable to cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers . these plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area , may be sufficiently successful to form a new species . some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed apomixis , forming clonal

a common european wild flower , growing as an annual or short-lived perennial .\n", "it has been introduced into north america , where it has spread . it is the progenitor of the cultivated pansy ,

and medicinal plant , the wild pansy has been cultivated since the middle ages and bred in britain since 1810 .\n", "according to roman mythology , the wild pansy turned into the love-in-idleness as cupid shot one of his arrows at the imperial votaress , but missed and instead struck it . as cupid is the god of desire , affection and erotic love , the flower 's juice received the trait , to act as a love potion . its name relates to the use of the flower , as it is often used for idleness or vileness acts .\n", "long before cultivated pansies were released into the trade in 1839 , \" v.

y10 , which was the first car to use fiat 's new fire ( fully integrated robotised engine ) . the primula was the car with which fiat introduced the particular front-wheel drive arrangement of engine , transmission and differential ( final drive ) that has become prevalent in its cars today .\n", "stellina and primula - autobianchi pioneers new concepts .\n", "even more important was the following year 's presentation , the autobianchi primula . it was fiat 's first attempt at a front-wheel drive car with a transverse engine , a configuration popularized by the british mini and allowing for very compact and efficient utilization of the body space . designed by fiat 's technical director , dante giacosa , it was launched under the autobianchi brand to test market reaction to the new concept . the primula 's particular configuration of front wheel drive with a transverse engine , but with a gearbox on the end of the engine and unequal length drive shafts , rather than a gearbox in the sump like the mini , became universal ; as did its use of conventional steel suspension in almost all other cars with the exception of citroen- usually macpherson struts at the front and a \" dead \" rear axle . indeed , peugeot in facelifting their 305 range on the early 1980s switched from their former adherence to the mini in-sump gearbox to the primula 's end-on gearbox configuration . the primula is thus a car design of far greater significance than is often realised , as its design influence spread far beyond even the mainstream high volume fiats such as the 127 and the 128 of the late 1960s . even though the new autobianchi was priced higher than fiat models of similar size , the car met with a favorable reception . fiat would gradually move all of its models to front-wheel drive .\n", "throughout its production run the primula was available as a two-door or five-door saloon , three-door of five-door hatchback , and two-door coupe , with either a 1,221 cc or a 1,197 cc four-cylinder engine . the top of the line primula coupe s used a 75 ps ( sae ) 1,438 cc four-cylinder from the fiat 124 special . the lack of a fifth gear limited the high-end capacity of all primula models .\n", "the a111 was derived from primula mechanicals , but much bigger and more spacious , marking the first ( and only ) entry of the brand into the small family car class . as usual , it was priced higher than similar fiat models , notably the first front-wheel drive fiat \" per se , \" the fiat 128 , and did not much find much favour with customers . after little more than 50,000 a111s were made , production ended in 1972 .\n", "with primula production ceasing in 1970 and the quick demise of the a111 , autobianchi became effectively a one-model brand . consequently , the a112 was marketed as a lancia from the mid-1970s in most markets , except for italy , france and israel , where it retained the autobianchi branding until the end of production .\n", "the fiat 128 's arrangement had numerous differences . as engineered by dante giacosa , it featured a transverse-mounted engine with unequal-length drive shafts and an innovative clutch release mechanism - an arrangement which fiat had strategically tested on a previous production model for a full five years , the primula from its less market-critical subsidiary , autobianchi . the layout enabled the engine and gearbox to be located side by side without sharing lubricating fluid while orienting an electrically controlled cooling fan toward fresh air flow . by using the primula as a test-bed , fiat was able to sufficiently resolve the layout 's disadvantages , including uneven side-to-side power transmission , uneven tire wear and potential torque steer , the tendency for the power of the engine alone to steer the car under heavy acceleration .\n", "at the request of the french government , important specimens from his collection were sent to paris and aroused the greatest interest . the jardin des plantes commissioned him to undertake scientific journeys through china to make further collections . he succeeded in obtaining many specimens of hitherto unknown animals and plants , and the value of his comprehensive collections for the advance of systematic zoology and especially for the advancement of animal geography received universal recognition from the scientific wo at paris in april , 1888 . he had found in china all together 200 species of wild animals , of which 63 were hitherto unknown to zoologists , and 807 species of birds , 65 of which had not been described before . he made a large collection of reptiles , amphibians , and fishes and handed it over to specialists for further study . pere david 's rat snake ( \" elaphe davidi \" ) was named in his honor by henri emile sauvage in 1884 . also , a large number of moths and insects , many of them hitherto unknown , were brought to the museum of the jardin des plantes . what father david 's scientific journeys meant for botany may be inferred from the fact that among the rhododendrons which he collected no less than fifty-two new species were found and among the primulae about forty , while the western mountains of china furnished an even greater number of hitherto unknown species of gentian .\n", "adults are particularly fond of nectar-rich flowers with a long and narrow calyx , since they can then take advantage of their long proboscis and avoid competition from other insects . flowers with longer tubes typically present the feeding animal a higher nectar reward . proboscis length is thought to have been evolutionarily impacted by the length of flower feeding tubes . examples of such plants include \" centranthus , \" \" jasminum , \" \" buddleia , \" \" nicotiana , \" \" primula

other possible glycosides , the root yields the triterpenoid glycoside which is highly toxic and occurs in \" cyclamen \" species , also a member of the subfamily myrsinoideae , and arguably also in the primulaceae .\n", "the isle has the highest number of species of native and anciently introduced wild flowers of any area of comparable size in britain . this is largely due to the varied geology

is the best time , and the largest population is usually in the field to the west of dancing ledge . smaller numbers can be seen on a shorter walk in durlston country park . this orchid is the logo of the dorset wildlife trust . cowslip meadows ( \" primula veris \" and \" primula deorum \" ) are at their best shortly afterwards and durlston country park has several large ones .\n", "a subsequent program , the citroen prototype y , was developed in the early 1970s in co-operation with fiat , to replace the 2cv-based citroen ami - using lessons from the citroen g-mini and en101 projects . prototype y used the fiat 127 platform with the pioneering transverse front-engine , front wheel drive layout fiat had test-marketed in the autobianchi primula .\n", "the silver birch has an open canopy which allows plenty of light to reach the ground . this allows a variety of mosses , grasses , and flowering plants to grow beneath , which in turn attract insects . flowering plants often

front-wheel-drive layout , with the transmission mounted on the end of the engine . both design ideas had been fully vetted by fiat , using its autobianchi subsidiary 1964 primula , 1969 a112 and a111 - precisely because the models were not targeted for large production . the larger fiat 128 , launched in 1969 , was the first fiat-badged car to use the same transverse powertrain layout . the 127 , like the a112 , used a shrunken version of the 128 platform , as well as the rugged fiat ohv 100 series 903 cc engine that had powered the autobianchi and , with various cylinder capacities , earlier

slavery , etc . ) , autocratic religions ( e.g. , fundamentalist islam , roman catholicism , etc . ) , patriarchy , heterosexism , white supremacy , and imperialism . \" however , anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed . the principle of equal liberty is closer to anarchist political ethics in that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions . this entails that liberty and equality cannot be implemented within the state , resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy .\n", "sexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists , but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing . however , sexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as benjamin tucker , who opposed age of consent laws , believing they would benefit predatory men . a historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was free love . in contemporary anarchism , this current survives as a tendency to support polyamory and queer anarchism . free love advocates were against marriage , which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women , largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men . the notion of free love was much broader and included a critique of the established order that limited women 's sexual freedom and pleasure . those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses , where large groups of travelers , anarchists and other activists slept in beds together . free love had roots both in europe and the united states . however , some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love . anarchist feminists were advocates of free love , against marriage , pro-choice ( utilising a contemporary term ) and had a similar agenda . anarchist and non-anarchist feminists differed on suffrage , but they were nonetheless supportive of one another .\n", "during the second half of the 20th century , anarchism intermingled with the second wave of feminism , radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well . by the latest decades of the 20th century , anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women , gays , queers and other marginalised groups , with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents . with the third wave of feminism , sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists , yielding a post-structuralist critique of sexual normality . however , some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking , suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation .\n", "the rural-dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans , but it did not relieve them of paying taxes . partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south , the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools . in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds , which paid one-third of the construction costs . the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest . black residents effectively taxed themselves twice , by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools , which were built in many rural areas . they often donated land and labor as well .\n", "beginning in 1913 , the first 80 rosenwald schools were built in alabama for african-american children . a total of 387 schools , seven teachers ' houses , and several

in the \" iliad , \" it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship . homer does not suggest that achilles and his close friend patroclus were lovers . although there is no direct evidence in the text of the \" iliad \" that achilles and patroclus were lovers , this theory was expressed by some later authors . commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures . in 5th-century bc athens , the intense bond was often viewed in light of the greek custom of \" paiderasteia . \" in plato 's \" symposium , \" the participants in a dialogue about love assume that achilles and patroclus were a couple ; phaedrus argues that achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and patroclus was the lover . however , ancient greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual , and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women . many

name was \" flor das cinco chagas \" or \" flower of the five wounds \" to illustrate the crucifixion of christ , with other plant components also named after an emblem in the passion of jesus .\n", "the anthracnose , a canker caused by \" colletotrichum gloeosporiodes , \" is a pathogen of the passion fruit creating dark and sunken lesions of the trunk . by attacking mature passion fruit trees ,

. attached to the frangipani family of rome , his election as pope was contested by a rival candidate , celestine ii , and force was used to guarantee his election .\n", "by 1124 , there were two great factions dominating local politics in rome : the frangipani family , which controlled the region around the fortified colosseum and supported the northern cardinals , and the pierleoni family , which controlled the tiber island and the fortress of the theatre of marcellus and supported the italian cardinals . with callixtus ii 's death on 13 december 1124 , both families agreed that the election of the next pope should be in three days time , in accordance with the church canons . the frangipani , led by leo frangipani , pushed for the delay in order that they could promote their preferred candidate , lamberto , but the people were eager to see saxo de anagni , the cardinal-priest of san stefano in celiomonte elected as the next pope . leo , eager to ensure a valid election , approached key members of every cardinal 's entourage , promising each one that he would support their master when the voting for the election was underway .\n", "on 16 december , all the cardinals , including lamberto , assembled in the chapel of the monastery of st. pancratius attached to the south of the lateran basilica . there , at the suggestion of jonathas , the cardinal-deacon of santi cosma e damiano , who was a partisan of the pierleoni family , the cardinals unanimously elected as pope the cardinal-priest of sant 'anastasia , theobaldo boccapecci , who took the name celestine ii . he had only just put on the red mantle and the \" te deum \" was being sung when an armed party of frangipani supporters ( in a move pre-arranged with cardinal aymeric ) burst in , attacked the newly enthroned celestine , who was wounded , and acclaimed lamberto as pope . since celestine had not been formally consecrated pope , the wounded candidate declared himself willing to resign , but the pierleoni family and their supporters refused to accept lamberto , who in the confusion had been proclaimed pope under the name honorius ii .\n", "rome descended into factional infighting , while cardinal aymeric and leo frangipani attempted to win over the resistance of urban , the city prefect , and the pierleoni family with bribes and extravagant promises . eventually , celestine 's supporters abandoned him , leaving honorius the only contender for the papal throne . honorius , unwilling to accept the throne in such a manner , resigned his position before all of the assembled cardinals , but was immediately and unanimously re-elected and consecrated on 21 december 1124 .\n", "after almost a year of suffering a painful illness , honorius fell seriously ill in early 1130 . cardinal aymeric and the frangipani family began planning their next moves , and honorius was taken to the san gregorio magno al celio monastery , which was located in the territory controlled by the frangipani . supporters of the pierleoni family , already preparing to back pietro pierleoni on a rumor that honorius had died , stormed the monastery of the dying honorius , hoping to force the election of pietro . only the sight of the still living honorius in full pontifical robes forced them to disperse .\n", "nevertheless , cardinal aymeric 's plans had not yet reached fruition when honorius died on the evening of 13 february 1130 . the cardinals supporting the frangipani immediately closed the monastery gates and refused to allow anyone inside . the next day , and contrary to the usual customs , honorius was quickly buried without any pomp or ceremony in the monastery , as the hand-picked cardinals got around to electing gregorio papareschi , who took the name pope innocent ii . at the same time , the excluded cardinals , most of whom were supporters of the pierleoni family , elected pietro pierleoni , who took the name anacletus ii , throwing the church once again into schism . honorius eventually transferred from the monastery to the lateran for reburial once innocent ii had been elected . he was buried in the south transept next to the body of callixtus ii .\n", "the way in which honorius was elected meant that he became a creature , not only of cardinal aymeric , but also of the frangipani family . aymeric expanded his powerbase further , with honorius elevating mostly non-roman candidates to the college of cardinals , while papal legates were now chosen solely within the papal circle . honorius favoured the newer monastic orders , such as the augustinians , a departure from the policies of the older gregorian popes who favoured traditional orders such as the benedictines .\n", "at the same time , he found himself drawn into the continued chaos of local roman politics , as the frangipani enjoyed their influence at the papal court , while the pierleoni family continually fought against them and against honorius . their ceaseless infighting , repressed during the pontificate of calixtus ii , broke out again , and honorius found he did not have the resources to suppress the pierleoni , nor the authority to rein in the frangipani . honorius was required to engage in a number of petty wars in rome , which wasted his time and were in the long haul unsuccessful in restoring order in the streets . the continued chaos would be instrumental in the events that saw the resurrection of republican sentiment in the city and the eventual establishment of the commune of rome in the following decade .\n", "to ensure that his victory against the angevins would stand , nicholas iii decided to go forward with a much needed addition to the sacred college of cardinals . at his first opportunity , on 12 march 1278 , he created ten cardinals . five cardinal bishops were named : latino frangipani malabranca , op , of rome ( nicholas iii 's nephew by his sister mabilia ) ; erhard de lessines ( lesigny ) , of langres , son of guillaume , marshal of champagne ; bentivenga de bentivengis , o.min. , of aquasparta ; robert kilwardby , op , archbishop of canterbury ; and ordono ( ordeonio ) alvarez , bishop of braga . two cardinal-priests were named : gerardo bianchi of parma , and girolamo masci d ' ascoli , o.min. , of picenum . he also appointed three cardinal-deacons : giordano orsini , brother of pope nicholas iii , of rome ; giacomo colonna of rome ; and gerardo cupalates , o.min. , of piacenza . the effect of these creations was to seriously dilute the angevin influence in the sacred college , and to considerably increase the monastic element , especially the franciscan one . it needs to be recalled that nicholas iii was the governor , corrector , and protector of the franciscans . the roman influence was also strengthened . the inevitable consequence would be that the next pope too would not be a creature of charles i of sicily .\n", "he was born in gravina in puglia , the eldest of six sons of ferdinando iii orsini , duke of gravina , and giovanna frangipani della tolfa , from toritto . a member of the orsini of rome , he was the third and last member of that family to become pope . at the age of eighteen he resigned his inheritance and entered the dominican order where he received the name of \" vincenzo maria . \" he was ordained to the priesthood in february 1671 .\n", "in 1130 , as pope honorius ii lay dying , the cardinals decided to entrust the election to a commission of eight men led by papal chancellor haimeric , who had his candidate cardinal gregorio papareschi hastily elected as pope innocent ii . he was consecrated on 14 february , the day after honorius ' death . the other cardinals announced that innocent had not been canonically elected and chose anacletus ii , a roman whose family were the enemy of haimeric 's supporters , the frangipani . anacletus ' mixed group of supporters were powerful enough to take control of rome while innocent was forced to flee north . based on a simple majority of the entire college of cardinals , anacletus was the canonically elected pope , and innocent was the antipope . however , the legislation of pope nicholas ii pre-empted the choice of the majority of the cardinal priests and cardinal deacons . this rule was changed by the second lateran council of 1139 .\n", "bernardo was elected pope on 15 february 1145 , the same day as the death of his predecessor , lucius ii , who had unwisely decided to take the offensive against the roman senate and was killed by a \" heavy stone \" thrown at him during an attack on the capitol . he took the pontifical name eugene iii . he was \" a simple character , gentle and retiring - not at all , men thought , the material of which popes are made . \" he owed his elevation partly to the fact that no one was eager to accept an office the duties of which were at the time so difficult and dangerous and because the election was \" held on safe frangipani

to go once more into exile . he set out for france , consecrating the cathedral of pisa on the way , and arrived at marseille in october . he was received with great enthusiasm at avignon , montpellier and other cities , held a synod at vienne in january 1119 , and was planning to hold a general council to settle the investiture contest when he died at abbey of cluny .\n", "while waiting for conrad 's reply , lucius decided to take matters into his own hands . turning to the roman aristocracy , in particular the frangipani family , he gave them the fortress of the circus maximus on 31 january 1145 , allowing them complete control of the southern portion of the palatine hill . the roman forum had become a battleground , and the confusion prevented lucius from travelling to the aventine hill to ordain the abbot of san saba on 20 january 1145 .\n", "finally , lucius marched against the senatorial positions on the capitol with a small army . he was driven back by giordano , and according to godfrey of viterbo , he was seriously injured during this battle ( by a thrown stone ) . he did not recover from his injuries and died on 15 february 1145 at san gregorio magno al celio , where he was under the protection of the neighbouring frangipani fortress .\n", "the colosseum underwent several radical changes of use . by the late 6th century a small chapel had been built

canvases devoted to form and color and line . in short , pierrot became an alter-ego of the artist , specifically of the famously alienated artist of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . his physical insularity ; his poignant lapses into mutism , the legacy of the great mime deburau ; his white face and costume , suggesting not only innocence but the pallor of the dead ; his often frustrated pursuit of columbine , coupled with his never-to-be-vanquished unworldly naivete - all conspired to lift him out of the circumscribed world of the \" commedia dell 'arte \" and into the larger realm of myth . much of that mythic quality ( \" i 'm pierrot , \" said david bowie : \" i 'm everyman \" ) still adheres to the \" sad clown \" of the postmodern era .\n", "he is sometimes said to be a french variant of the sixteenth-century italian pedrolino , but the two types have little but their names ( \" little pete \" ) and social stations in common . both are comic servants , but pedrolino , as a so-called first \" zanni , \" often acts with cunning and daring , an engine of the plot in the scenarios where he appears . pierrot , on the other hand , as a \" second \" \" zanni , \" is a static character in his earliest incarnations , \" standing on the periphery of the action , \" dispensing advice that seems to him sage , and courting - unsuccessfully - his master 's young daughter , columbine , with bashfulness and indecision .\n", "among the french dramatists who wrote for the italians and who gave pierrot life on their stage were jean palaprat , claude-ignace brugiere de barante , antoine houdar de la motte , and the most sensitive of his early interpreters , jean-francois regnard . he acquires there a very distinctive personality . he seems an anomaly among the busy social creatures that surround him ; he is isolated , out of touch . columbine laughs at his advances ; his masters who are in pursuit of pretty young wives brush off his warnings to act their age . his is a solitary voice , and his estrangement , however comic , bears the pathos of the portraits - watteau 's chief among them - that one encounters in the centuries to come .\n", "a more long-lasting development occurred in denmark . in that same year , 1800 , a troupe of italian players led by pasquale casorti began giving performances in dyrehavsbakken , then a well-known site for entertainers , hawkers , and inn-keepers . casorti 's son , giuseppe ( 1749-1826 ) , had undoubtedly been impressed by the pierrots they had seen while touring france in the late eighteenth century , for he assumed the role and began appearing as pierrot in his own pantomimes , which now had a formulaic structure ( cassander , father of columbine , and pierrot , his dim-witted servant , undertake a mad pursuit of columbine and her rogue lover , harlequin ) . the formula has proven enduring : pierrot is still a fixture at bakken , the oldest amusement park in the world , where he plays the nitwit talking to and entertaining children , and at nearby tivoli gardens , the second oldest , where the harlequin and columbine act is performed as a pantomime and ballet . pierrot - as \" pjerrot , \" with his boat-like hat and scarlet grin - remains one of the parks ' chief attractions .\n", "deburau seems to have had a predilection for \" realistic \" pantomime - a predilection that , as will later become evident here , led eventually to calls for pierrot 's expulsion from it . but the pantomime that had the greatest appeal to his public was the \" pantomime-arlequinade-feerie , \" sometimes \" in the english style \" ( i.e. , with a prologue in which characters were transformed into the \" commedia \" types ) . the action unfolded in fairy-land , peopled with good and bad spirits who both advanced and impeded the plot , which was interlarded with comically violent ( and often scabrous ) mayhem . as in the bakken pantomimes , that plot hinged upon cassander 's pursuit of harlequin and columbine - but it was complicated , in baptiste 's interpretation , by a clever and ambiguous pierrot . baptiste 's pierrot was both a fool and no fool ; he was cassandre 's valet but no one 's servant . he was an embodiment of comic contrasts , showing\n", "when gustave courbet drew a pencil illustration for \" the black arm \" ( 1856 ) , a pantomime by fernand desnoyers written for another mime , paul legrand ( see next section ) , the pierrot who quakes with fear as a black arm snakes up from the ground before him is clearly a child of the pierrot in \" the ol ' clo 's man . \" so , too , are honore daumier 's pierrots : creatures often suffering a harrowing anguish . in 1860 , deburau was directly credited with inspiring such anguish , when , in a novella called \" pierrot \" by henri riviere , the mime-protagonist blames his real-life murder of a treacherous harlequin on baptiste 's \" sinister \" cruelties . among the most celebrated of pantomimes in the latter part of the century would appear sensitive moon-mad souls duped into criminality - usually by love of a fickle columbine - and so inevitably marked for destruction ( paul margueritte 's \" pierrot , murderer of his wife \" [ 1881 ] ; the mime severin 's \" poor pierrot \" [ 1891 ] ; catulle mendes ' \" ol ' clo 's man \" [ 1896 ] , modeled on gautier 's \" review \" )

now classified in austrobaileyales and chloranthaceae . they were not removed until the advent of molecular data in the late 20th century ; their previous inclusion made it harder to determine the

are known as sepals and petals ( or tepals in flowers such as \" magnolia \" where sepals and petals are not distinguishable from each other ) . the outer series ( calyx of sepals ) is usually green and leaf-like , and functions to protect the rest of the flower , especially the bud . the inner series ( corolla of petals ) is , in general , white or brightly colored , and is more delicate in structure . it functions to attract insect or bird pollinators . attraction is effected by color , scent , and nectar , which may be secreted in some part of the flower . the characteristics that

system use the name angiospermae , at the assigned rank of subdivision . the reveal system treated flowering plants as subdivision magnoliophytina , but later split it to magnoliopsida , liliopsida , and rosopsida . the takhtajan system and cronquist system treat this group at the rank of division , leading to the name magnoliophyta ( from the family name magnoliaceae ) . the dahlgren system and thorne system ( 1992 ) treat this group at the rank of class , leading to the name magnoliopsida . the apg system of 1998 , and the later 2003 and 2009 revisions , treat the flowering plants as a clade called angiosperms without a formal botanical name . a formal classification was published alongside the 2009 revision in which the flowering plants form the subclass magnoliidae .\n", "which in the cronquist system are called magnoliopsida ( at the rank of class , formed from the family name magnoliaceae ) and liliopsida ( at the rank of class , formed from the family name liliaceae ) . other descriptive names allowed by article 16 of the icbn include dicotyledones or dicotyledoneae , and monocotyledones or monocotyledoneae , which have a long history of use . in english , a member of either group may be called a dicotyledon ( plural dicotyledons ) and monocotyledon ( plural monocotyledons ) , or abbreviated , as dicot ( plural dicots ) and monocot ( plural monocots ) . these names derive from the observation that the dicots most often have two cotyledons , or embryonic leaves , within each seed . the monocots usually have only one , but the rule is not absolute either way . from a broad diagnostic point of view , the number of cotyledons is neither a particularly handy , nor a reliable character .\n", "by the late cretaceous , angiosperms appear to have dominated environments formerly occupied by ferns and cycadophytes , but large canopy-forming trees replaced conifers as the dominant trees only close to the end of the cretaceous 66 million years ago or even later , at the beginning of the tertiary . the radiation of herbaceous angiosperms occurred much later . yet , many fossil plants recognisable as belonging to modern families ( including beech , oak , maple , and magnolia ) had already appeared by the late cretaceous . flowering plants appeared in australia about 126 million years ago . this also pushed the age of ancient australian vertebrates ,

the highest yield of transuranium elements . in the dependence on the atomic mass number , the yield showed a saw-tooth behavior with the lower values for odd isotopes , due to their higher fission rates . the major practical problem of the entire proposal , however , was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast . aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4 of the total amount and collection of tons of corals at enewetak atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude . extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the hutch

toward art deco . the swiss artist hermann obrist , living in munich , illustrated the \" coup de fouet \" or whiplash motif , a highly stylized double curve suggesting motion taken from the stem of the cyclamen flower .\n", "early art nouveau also often featured more stylized forms expressing movement , such as the \" coup de fouet \" or \" whiplash \" line , depicted in the cyclamen plants drawn by designer hermann obrist in 1894 . a description published in \" pan \" magazine of hermann obrist 's wall hanging \" cyclamen \" ( 1894 ) , compared it to the \" sudden violent curves generated by the crack of a whip , \" the term \" whiplash , \" though it was originally used to ridicule the style , is frequently applied to the characteristic curves employed by art nouveau artists . such decorative undulating and flowing lines in a syncopated rhythm and asymmetrical shape , are often found in the architecture , painting , sculpture , and other forms of art nouveau design .\n", "art nouveau architecture was a reaction against the eclectic styles that dominated european architecture in the second half of the 19th century . it was expressed through decoration : either ornamental ( based on flowers and plants , e.g. thistles , irises , cyclamens , orchids , water lilies etc . ) or sculptural ( see the respective section below ) . while faces of people ( or mascarons ) are referred to ornament , the use of people in different forms of sculpture ( statues and reliefs : see the respective section below ) was also common in some forms of art nouveau . before vienna secession , jugendstil and the various forms of the national romantic style facades were asymmetrical , and often decorated with polychrome ceramic tiles . the decoration usually suggested movement ; there was no distinction between the structure and the ornament . a curling or \" whiplash \" motif , based on the forms of plants and flowers , was widely used in the early art nouveau , but decoration became more abstract and symmetrical in vienna secession and other later versions of the style , as in the palais stoclet in brussels ( 1905-1911 ) .\n", "in france , a major contribution was made by designer eugene grasset who in 1896 published \" la plante et ses applications ornamentales , \" suggesting art nouveau designs based on different flowers and plants . many patterns were designed for and produced by for the major french textile manufacturers in mulhouse , lille and lyon , by german and belgian workshops . the german designer hermann obrist specialized in floral patterns , particularly the cyclamen and the \" whiplash \" style based on flower stems , which became a major motif of the style . the belgian henry van de velde presented a textile work , \" la veillee d 'anges , \" at the salon \" la libre esthethique \" in brussels , inspired by the symbolism of paul gauguin and of the nabis . in the netherlands , textiles were often inspired by batik patterns from the dutch colonies in the east indies . folk art also inspired the creation of tapestries , carpets , embroidery and textiles in central europe and scandinavia , in the work of gerhard munthe and frida hansen in norway . the \" five swans \" design of otto eckmann appeared in more than one hundred different versions . the hungarian designer janos vaszary combined art nouveau elements with folkloric themes .\n", "it is estimated that about 5,000 species of vascular plants are found in the horn , about half of which are endemic . endemism is most developed in socotra and northern somalia . the region has two endemic plant families : the barbeyaceae and the dirachmaceae . among the other remarkable species , there are the cucumber tree found only on socotra ( \" dendrosicyos socotrana \" ) , the bankouale palm , the yeheb nut , and the somali cyclamen .\n", "there are many types of wildflowers , including rare ' spentzes ' or cyclamen and poppies . as well as pine trees , there are cypress and olive trees . birds species include partridges , quails , and many migratory birds , which are subject to local hunting . mammals include rabbits , feral cats , and goats .\n", "having of floor space , the flower auction building of is one of the largest commercial buildings in the world . its close proximity to schiphol airport allows the growers access to markets worldwide . since january 1 , 2008 the aalsmeer flower auction has merged with the united auctions of naaldwijk and rijnsburg under the name floraholland , and is the largest auction market in the world . the flowers that are grown and sold here are carnations , roses , lilacs , freesias , chrysanthemums , cyclamens , and begonias .\n", "tuberous begonia , yams , and cyclamen are commonly grown stem tubers . mignonette vine ( \" anredera cordifolia \" ) produces aerial stem tubers on vines , the tubers fall to the ground and grow . \" plectranthus esculentus \" of the mint family lamiaceae , produces tuberous under ground organs from the base of the stem , weighing up to per tuber , forming from axillary buds producing short stolons that grow into tubers . even though legumes are not commonly associated with forming stem tubers , \" lathyrus tuberosus \" is an example native to asia and europe , where it was once even grown as a crop .\n", "to the rear of the property is the noted parterre garden which is located on the east lawn . originally created as a victorian sunken garden it was remodelled by lindsay in the early 1930s . set around an 18th-century listed stone fountain , she divided the garden into four large , colourful herbaceous beds surrounded by l shaped borders stocked with roses and catmint with an acorn shaped yew marking each corner . in the terraces above the parterre there are plantings of peony , seasonal beds and the double borders created in 2006 , contain a wide variety of perennials , shrubs and grasses with colours ranging from hot to cool . close by , are the white and black borders which were established in 2009 , together with a collection of elaeagnus . the western side of the garden features the lawned acre which is fringed by a spreading oriental plane tree . outdoor sports such as croquet are played here in the summer months . further highlights are a collection of magnolia underplanted with autumn cyclamen , the shell fountain and the kitchen garden . to the north of the parterre is the wilderness garden which is bisected by radial grassed avenues flanked with turkey oak , lime and beech trees and naturalised bulbs .\n", "in 1916 korda established his own production company , corvin film . its first film was \" white nights \" ( 1916 ) , which was a big success . korda went on to build corvin into one of the largest film companies in hungary with such productions as \" the grandmother \" ( 1916 ) , \" tales of the typewriter \" ( 1916 ) , \" the man with two hearts \" ( 1916 ) , \" the one

in the 1967 giro d 'italia , the red jersey was added for the leader of the classification . however , in 1969 the red jersey was changed to a cyclamen ( purple ) colored jersey . it remained that color until 2010 when the organizers chose to change the jersey back to the color red ; in a return to the original color scheme for the three minor classifications , which reflected the colors of the italian flag . however , in april 2017 rcs sport , the organisers of the giro , announced that the \" maglia ciclamino \" would be revived for the 2017 giro d 'italia .\n", "bilberry , cranberry and cowberry are restricted to dry places and lady 's slipper orchid occurs in sheltered spots . below the waxenstein are fields with raspberries and occasionally wild strawberries too . the alpine poppy

following snowmelt dark stonecrop and snow gentian are the first to appear , their seeds beginning to germinate as early as august . other well-known alpine plants like edelweiss , gentians and , more rarely , cyclamen also flower on the zugspitze .\n", "the herb and its seed contain saponins , which could explain why fresh material is strongly haemolytic . among other possible glycosides , the root yields the triterpenoid glycoside which is highly toxic and occurs in \" cyclamen \" species , also a member of the subfamily myrsinoideae , and arguably also in the primulaceae .\n", "in some plants , the hypocotyl becomes enlarged as a storage organ . examples include cyclamen , gloxinia and celeriac . in cyclamen this storage organ is called a tuber .\n", "ma 'alot was established as a development town for jewish immigrants from romania , iran and morocco , in 1957 . the first homes were built on \" har harakafot \" ( cyclamen hill ) , known in arabic as \" bab al-hauwa \" ( \" gate of the winds \" ) .\n", "contemporary research relies largely on multiple lines of evidence to determine the mode of a speciation event ; that is , determining patterns of geographic distribution in conjunction with phylogenetic relatedness based on molecular techniques . this method was effectively introduced by john d. lynch in 1986 and numerous researchers have employed it and similar methods , yielding enlightening results . correlation of geographic distribution with phylogenetic data also spawned a sub-field of biogeography called vicariance biogeography developed by joel cracraft , james brown , mark v. lomolino , among other biologists specializing in ecology and biogeography . similarly , full analytical approaches have been proposed and applied to determine which speciation mode a species underwent in the past using various approaches or combinations thereof : species-level phylogenies , range overlaps , symmetry in range sizes between sister species pairs , and species movements within geographic ranges . molecular clock dating methods are also often employed to accurately gauge divergence times that reflect the fossil or geological record ( such as with the snapping shrimp separated by the closure of the isthmus of panama or speciation events within the genus \" cyclamen \" ) . other techniques used today have employed measures of gene flow between populations , ecological niche modelling ( such as in the case of the myrtle and audubon 's warblers or the environmentally-mediated speciation taking place among dendrobatid frogs in ecuador ) , and statistical testing of monophyletic groups . biotechnological advances have allowed for large scale , multi-locus genome comparisons ( such as with the possible allopatric speciation event that occurred between ancestral humans and chimpanzees ) , linking species ' evolutionary history with ecology and clarifying phylogenetic patterns .\n", "\" pilea \" ( aluminum plant ) is an example of a house plant that shows this effect . leaves of most \" cyclamen \" species show such patterned variegation , varying between plants , but consistent within each plant .\n", "cyclamen\n", "cyclamen ( or ) is a genus of 23 species of perennial flowering plants in the family primulaceae . cyclamen species are native to europe and the mediterranean basin east to iran , with one species in somalia . they grow from tubers and are valued for their flowers with upswept petals and variably patterned leaves .\n", "\" cyclamen \" is medieval latin , from earlier latin \" cyclaminos , \" from ancient

because of the round tuber . in english , the species of the genus are commonly called by the genus name .\n", "in many languages , cyclamen species are colloquially called by a name like the english sowbread , or swinebread ( because they are said to be eaten by pigs ) , based on medieval latin \" panis porcinus \" : \" saubrot \" in german , \" pain de pourceau \" in french , \" pan porcino \" in italian , and \" varkensbrood \" in dutch .\n", "cyclamens have a tuber , from which the leaves , flowers and roots grow . in most species , leaves come up in autumn , grow through the winter , and then die in spring , then the plant goes \" dormant \" through the dry mediterranean summer .\n", "the storage organ of the cyclamen is a round tuber that develops from the hypocotyl ( the stem of a seedling ) . it is often mistakenly called a corm , but a corm ( found in crocuses , for example ) has a papery tunic and a basal plate from which the roots grow . the storage organ of the cyclamen has no papery covering and , depending on the species , roots may grow out of any part . it is therefore properly classified as a tuber ( somewhat like a potato ) . the tuber may produce roots from the top , sides , or bottom , depending on the species . \" cyclamen persicum \" and \" cyclamen coum \" root from the bottom ; \" cyclamen hederifolium \" roots from the top and sides . \" cyclamen graecum \" has thick anchor roots on the bottom .\n", "the shape of the tuber may be near spherical , as in \" cyclamen coum \" or flattened , as in \" cyclamen hederifolium . \" in some older specimens of \" cyclamen purpurascens \" and \" cyclamen rohlfsianum , \" growing points on the tuber become separated by shoulders of tissue , and the tuber becomes misshapen . in most other species , the tuber is round in old age .\n", "the size of the tuber varies depending on species . in \" cyclamen hederifolium , \" older tubers commonly reach across , but in \" cyclamen parviflorum , \" tubers do not grow larger than across .\n", "the shape of the leaves varies between the species , and even between different specimens of the same species . \" cyclamen hederifolium \" and \" cyclamen repandum \" usually have leaves shaped like ivy , with angles and lobes , \" cyclamen coum \" has nearly round leaves , and \" cyclamen persicum \" has heart-shaped leaves with a pointed tip . the leaf margin may be smooth , as in \" cyclamen coum \" subsp . \" coum , \" or finely toothed , as in \" cyclamen graecum . \"\n", "the color of the upper side of leaves is variable , even within a species . most species have leaves variegated in several shades of green and silver , either in an irregular pattern of blotches or an arrowhead or christmas tree shape . in cultivation , cyclamens , especially species other than \" cyclamen persicum , \" are selected as often or more often for striking or unusual leaf patterns than for their flowers .\n", "most cyclamen species originate from the mediterranean , where summers are hot and dry and winters are cool and wet , and are summer-dormant : their leaves sprout in the autumn , remain through the winter , and wither the next spring . \" cyclamen purpurascens \" and \" cyclamen colchicum , \" however , originate from cooler regions in mountains , and their leaves remain through the summer and wither only after the next year 's leaves have developed .\n", "flowering time may be any month of the year , depending on the species . \" cyclamen hederifolium \" and \" cyclamen purpurascens \" bloom in summer and autumn , \" cyclamen persicum \" and \" cyclamen coum \" bloom in winter , and \" cyclamen repandum \" blooms in spring .\n", "each flower is on a stem coming from a growing point on the tuber . in all species , the stem is normally bent 150-180 \u00b0 at the tip , so that the nose of the flower faces downwards . \" cyclamen hederifolium \" ' stargazer ' is an exception to this ; its nose faces upwards . flowers have 5 petals , bent outwards or up , sometimes twisted , and connected at the base into a cup , and five sepals behind the cup .\n", "petal shape varies depending on species , and sometimes within the same species . \" cyclamen repandum \" has petals much longer than wide , \" cyclamen coum \" has stubby , almost round petals , and \" cyclamen hederifolium \" usually has petals with proportions between the two .\n", "petal color may be white , pink , or purple , often with darker color on the nose . many species have a pink form and a white form , but a few have only one color , such as \" cyclamen balearicum , \" which is always white .\n", "the dark color on the flower nose varies in shape : \" cyclamen persicum \" has a smooth band , \" cyclamen hederifolium \" has a streaky v , and \" cyclamen coum \" has an m-shaped splotch with two white or pink \" eyes \" beneath .\n", "in some species , such as \" cyclamen hederifolium , \" the petal edges at the nose are curved outwards into \" auricles \" ( latin for \" little ears \" ) . most species , like \" cyclamen persicum , \" have no auricles .\n", "in most species , the style protrudes 1-3 mm out of the nose of the flower , but the stamens are inside the flower . in \" cyclamen rohlfsianum , \" however , the cone of anthers sticks out prominently , about beyond the rim of the corolla , similar to shooting-stars ( \" dodecatheon \" ) .\n", "the flower stem coils or bends when the fruit begins to form . the stems of \" cyclamen hederifolium \" and \" cyclamen coum \" coil starting at the end , \" cyclamen persicum \" arches downwards but does not curl , \" cyclamen rohlfsianum \" coils starting near the tuber , and \" cyclamen graecum \" coils both directions , starting at the middle .\n", "cyclamen are commonly grown for their flowers , both outdoors and indoors in pots . several species , particularly \" cyclamen hederifolium , \" are hardy and can be grown outdoors in mild climates such as northwest europe and the pacific northwest of north america .\n", "cyclamen species range from frost-hardy to frost-tender .\n", "florist 's cyclamen .\n", "the cyclamen commonly sold by florists is \" cyclamen persicum , \" which is frost-tender . selected cyclamen cultivars can have white , bright pink , red or purple flowers . while flowering , florists ' cyclamens should be kept below , with the night time temperatures preferably between . temperatures above may induce the plant to go dormant .\n", "in many areas within the native range , cyclamen populations have been severely depleted by collection from the wild , often illegally , for the horticultural trade ; some species are now endangered as a result . however , in a few areas , plant conservation charities have educated local people to control the harvest carefully at a sustainable level , including sowing seed for future crops , both sustaining the wild populations and producing a reliable long-term income . many cyclamen are also propagated in nurseries without harm to the wild plants .\n"], "watercress": ["the traditional cuisine is famous for an abundance of vegetables and greens used seasonally in the dishes . fresh herbs , including mint , cilantro ( coriander ) , dill , basil , parsley , tarragon , leeks , chives , thyme , marjoram , green onion , and watercress , are very popular and often accompany main dishes on the table . climatic diversity and fertility of the land are reflected in the national dishes , which are based on fish from the caspian sea , local meat ( mainly mutton and beef ) , and an abundance of seasonal vegetables and greens . saffron-rice plov is the flagship food in azerbaijan and black tea is the national beverage . azerbaijanis often use traditional armudu ( pear-shaped ) glass as they have very strong tea culture . popular traditional dishes include bozbash ( lamb soup that exists in several regional varieties with the addition of different vegetables ) , qutab ( fried turnover with a filling of greens or minced meat ) and dushbara ( sort of dumplings of dough filled with ground meat and flavor ) .\n", "this family includes important agricultural crops , among which many vegetables such as cabbage , broccoli , cauliflower , kale , brussels sprouts , collard greens , savoy , kohlrabi , and gai lan ( \" brassica oleracea \" ) , turnip , napa cabbage , bomdong

brassica juncea \" and \" b. nigra \" respectively ) . vegetable oil is produced from the seeds of several species such as \" brassica napus \" ( rapeseed oil ) , perhaps providing the largest volume of vegetable oils of any species . woad ( \" isatis tinctoria \" ) was used in the past to produce a blue textile dye ( indigo ) , but has largely been replaced by the same substance from unrelated tropical species like \" indigofera tinctoria . \"\n", "other preserved lines , or heritage railways , have reopened lines previously closed by british rail . these range from picturesque rural branch lines like the keighley and worth valley railway to sections of mainline such as the great central railway . many have links to the national rail network , both at station interchanges , for example the severn valley railway between and kidderminster town , and physical rail connections like the watercress line at .\n", "cornwall is perhaps best known though for its pasties , a savoury dish made with pastry . today 's pasties usually contain a filling of beef steak , onion , potato and swede with salt and white pepper , but historically pasties had a variety of different fillings . \" turmut , ' tates and mate \" ( i.e. \" turnip , potatoes and meat , \" turnip being the cornish and scottish term for swede , itself an abbreviation of ' swedish turnip ' , the british term for rutabaga ) describes a filling once very common . for instance , the licky pasty contained mostly leeks , and the herb pasty contained watercress , parsley , and shallots . pasties are often locally referred to as \" oggies . \" historically , pasties were also often made with sweet fillings such as jam , apple and blackberry , plums or cherries .\n", "apart from vegetables that can be commonly seen , some

fortified with iron .\n", "watercress ( \" nasturtium officinale \" ) is a rapidly growing aquatic or semi aquatic perennial plant . because chemical agents do not provide efficient microbial reductions , watercress has been tested with gamma irradiation treatment in order to improve both safety and the shelf life of the product . it is traditionally used on horticultural products to prevent sprouting and post-packaging contamination , delay post-harvest ripening , maturation and senescence .\n", "shortly after this experiment lind retired from the navy and at first practised privately as a doctor . in 1753 , he published \" a treatise of the scurvy , \" which was virtually ignored . in 1758 he was appointed chief physician of the royal naval hospital haslar at gosport . when james cook went on his first voyage he carried wort ( 0.1 mg vitamin c per 100 g ) , sauerkraut ( 10-15 mg per 100 g ) and a syrup , or \" rob , \" of oranges and lemons ( the juice contains 40-60 mg of vitamin c per 100 g ) as antiscorbutics , but only the results of the trials on wort were published . in 1762 lind 's \" essay on the most effectual means of preserving the health of seamen \" appeared . in it he recommended growing salad - i.e. watercress ( 662 mg vitamin c per 100 g ) - on wet blankets . this was actually put in practice , and in the winter of 1775 the british army in north america was supplied with mustard and cress seeds . however lind , like most of the medical profession , believed that scurvy was essentially a result of ill-digested and putrefying food within the body , bad water , excessive work and living in a damp atmosphere which prevented healthful perspiration . thus , while he recognised the benefits of citrus fruit ( although he weakened the effect by switching to a boiled concentrated or \" rob , \" the production of which unfortunately destroyed the vitamin c ) , he never advocated citrus juice as a single solution . he believed that scurvy had multiple causes which therefore required multiple remedies .\n", "the diet requires restricting or eliminating foods high in phe , such as soybeans , egg whites , shrimp , chicken breast , spirulina , watercress , fish , nuts , crayfish , lobster , tuna , turkey , legumes , and lowfat cottage cheese . starchy foods , such as potatoes and corn are generally acceptable in controlled amounts , but the quantity of phe consumed from these foods must be monitored . a food diary is usually kept to record the amount of phe consumed with each meal , snack , or drink . an \" exchange \" system can be used to calculate the amount of phe in a food from the protein content identified on a nutritional information label . lower-protein \" medical food \" substitutes are often used in place of normal bread , pasta , and other grain-based foods , which contain a significant amount of phe . many fruits and vegetables are lower in phe and can be eaten in larger quantities . infants may still be breastfed to provide all of the benefits of breastmilk , but the quantity must also be monitored and supplementation for missing nutrients will be required . the sweetener aspartame , present in many diet foods and soft drinks , must also be avoided , as aspartame is metabolised into phenylalanine .\n", "as with most peoples in the north of europe in late antiquity , the picts were farmers living in small communities . cattle and horses were an obvious sign of wealth and prestige , sheep and pigs were kept in large numbers , and place names suggest that transhumance was common . animals were small by later standards , although horses from britain were imported into ireland as breed-stock to enlarge native horses . from irish sources it appears that the elite engaged in competitive cattle-breeding for size , and this may have been the case in pictland also . carvings show hunting with dogs , and also , unlike in ireland , with falcons . cereal crops included wheat , barley , oats and rye . vegetables included kale , cabbage , onions and leeks , peas and beans and turnips , and some types no longer common , such as skirret . plants such as wild garlic , nettles and watercress may have been gathered in the wild . the pastoral economy meant that hides and leather were readily available . wool was the main source of fibres for clothing , and flax was also common , although it is not clear if they grew it for fibres , for oil , or as a foodstuff . fish , shellfish , seals , and whales were exploited along coasts and rivers . the importance of domesticated animals suggests that meat and milk products were a major part of the diet of ordinary people , while the elite would have eaten a diet rich in meat from farming and hunting .\n",

name because they produce an oil similar to that of watercress ( \" nasturtium officinale \" ) .\n", "all parts of \" tropaeolum majus \" are edible . the flower has most often been consumed , making for an especially ornamental salad ingredient ; it has a slightly peppery taste reminiscent of watercress , and is also used in stir fry . the flowers contain about 130 mg vitamin c per , about the same amount as is contained in parsley . moreover , they contain up to 45 mg of lutein per 100 g , which is the highest amount found in any edible plant . the unripe seed pods can be harvested and dropped into spiced vinegar to produce a condiment and garnish , sometimes used in place of capers .\n", "a green salad or garden salad is most often composed of leafy vegetables such as lettuce

to bearded dragons , but they can also be fed other insects such as black soldier fly larvae , spiders , locusts , superworms , silkworms , butterworms , fruit flies , grasshoppers , mealworms and hornworms . bearded dragons also eat increasing amounts of plant-based food as they grow ; adults should have a diet consisting primarily of plant matter , the most important of which are leafy greens . spring greens , endive , kale , rocket , chinese leaf , and watercress are all suitable vegetables , as are butternut squash , pea shoots , bell peppers , and many other plants . it is important to check before feeding something new to a bearded dragon , as some things can be toxic to them or will act to bind calcium in their diet , preventing them from being able to absorb calcium . this diet is also seasonal , meaning that it changes with the availability of live prey in the wild . studies of wild pogona vitticeps have shown that termites compose over 60 % of the stomach contents of those studied . bearded dragons , like many reptiles , are opportunistic and will binge feed on live food sources where available , preferring live prey over plant matter . bearded dragons also require

the english name monkshood . two to 10 petals are present . the two upper petals are large and are placed under the hood of the calyx and are supported on long stalks . they have a hollow spur at their apex , containing the nectar . the other petals are small and scale-like or nonforming . the three to five carpels are partially fused at the base .\n", "monkshood and other members of the genus \" aconitum \" contain substantial amounts of the highly toxic aconitine and related alkaloids , especially in their roots and tubers . aconitine is a potent neurotoxin and cardiotoxin that causes persistent depolarization of neuronal sodium channels in tetrodotoxin-sensitive tissues . the influx of sodium through these channels and the delay in their repolarization increases their excitability and may lead to diarrhea , convulsions , ventricular arrhythmia and death .\n", "aconite also lends itself to use as a fictional poison in modern settings . an overdose of aconite was the method by

were preparations meant to encourage hallucinatory dreaming ; a possible explanation for the inclusion of belladonna and opium poppy in flying ointments concerns the known antagonism between tropane alkaloids of belladonna ( scopolamine ) and opiate alkaloids in the opium poppy , \" papaver somniferum \" ( to be specific , morphine ) , which produces a dream-like waking state ( hypnagogia ) or

of the genus \" amaryllis \" are known as belladonna lily , jersey lily , naked lady , amarillo , easter lily in southern australia or , in south africa , march lily due to its propensity to flower around march . this is one of numerous genera with the common name \" lily \" due to their flower shape and growth habit . however , they are only distantly related to the true lily , \" lilium . \"

plant growth occurs from this basal plate . roots emerge from the underside of the base , and new stems and leaves from the upper side . tunicate bulbs have dry , membranous outer scales that protect

precisely what herbert meant by the name is not certain . for many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names \" amaryllis \" and \" hippeastrum , \" one result of which is that the common name amaryllis is mainly used for cultivars of this genus , often sold as indoor flowering bulbs particularly at christmas in the northern hemisphere . by contrast the generic name \" amaryllis \" applies to bulbs from south africa , usually grown outdoors . the genus is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the americas from argentina north to mexico and the caribbean

be placed outside in the summer , and after a dormancy period , be induced to rebloom inside in the winter .\n", "most \" hippeastrum \" bulbs are tunicate ( a protective dry outer layer and fleshy

\" -36 \" ) long and 2.5-5 cm ( 1 \" -2 \" ) wide . the leaves are hysteranthous ( develop after flowering ) , sessile ( borne directly from the stem or peduncle ) , rarely persistent and subpetiolate

had named ( in an unpublished manuscript ) a west indian species as \" amaryllis equestris , \" because of its similarity to the african genus \" amaryllis . \" this name and attribution was first published by william aiton in 1789 , in his \" hortus kewensis . \" which species this was is not known precisely . however , in 1795 william curtis , described \" amaryllis equestris \" or the barbados lily in his \" botanical magazine , \" referring to aiton :\n", "although the 1987 decision settled the question of the scientific name of the genus , the common name \" amaryllis \"

\"\n", "at the time both south african and south american plants were placed in this same genus . by the early nineteenth century \" amaryllis \" had become a polymorphic ( diverse ) genus with about 50 species from what we would consider a dozen genera today , and attempts were made to separate it into different genera . this work commenced in 1819 with the contributions of the english botanist , the revd . william herbert in curtis 's botanical magazine which he expanded in 1821 in the botanical register , identifying 14 species of the new genus of \" hippeastrum , \" and only leaving three species in \" amaryllis . \" the rest of the \" amaryllis \" species he transferred to other genera , several of which he created . herbert further refined his descriptions of \" hippeastrum \" in his work on the amaryllidaceae in 1837 .\n", "since then a key question has been whether linnaeus 's original type was a south african plant ( now \" amaryllis \" ) or a south american plant ( now \" hippeastrum \" ) . if the latter , the correct name for the genus \" hippeastrum \" would then be \" amaryllis \" and a new name would need to be found for the south african genus . in 1938 johannes cornelius theodorus uphof ( jct uphof ) claimed , with some evidence , that the plant was in fact the south american \" hippeastrum equestre \" ( syn . \" amaryllis equestris \" ( linn. fil . ) ex aiton , accepted name \" h. puniceum \" ) a plant which carl linnaeus ' son , linnaeus the younger ( \" linn. fil . \" ) had described c . 1781-3 ( unpublished ) but soon after appearing in the \" hortus kewensis \" of 1789 . this paper sparked a debate over the next half century , that delayed the official transfer of species from \" amaryllis \" to \" hippeastrum . \" this debate involved botanists on both sides of the atlantic and the final outcome was a decision by the 14th international botanical congress in 1987 that \" amaryllis \" should be a \" nomen conservandum \" ( conserved name , i.e. , correct regardless of priority ) and ultimately based on a specimen of the south african \" amaryllis belladonna \" from the clifford herbarium . thus \" amaryllis \" is the correct name for the south african genus , not the south american genus ( \" hippeastrum \" ) .\n", "the second issue is whether the name should be \" leopoldia . \" in 1819 herbert had proposed \" leopoldia \" as a \" nomen provisorium \" ( provisional name ) for the same taxon as he called \" hippeastrum \" in 1821 . although \" leopoldia \" was subsequently validated ( i.e. , became the correct name ) , this was overlooked , and \" hippeastrum \" rather than \" leopoldia \" was used for the genus of new world amaryllids . following filippo parlatore in 1845 , the name \" leopoldia \" was used for a genus of grape hyacinth species , allied to \" muscari . \" in order to preserve the widespread usage of both \" hippeastrum \" and \" leopoldia , \" fabio garbari and werner greuter proposed in 1970 that herbert 's \" hippeastrum \" and parlatore 's \" leopoldia \" should be conserved and herbert 's \" leopoldia \" rejected . this was accepted and \" hippeastrum \" is now a \" nomen conservandum \" ( conserved name ) , \" i.e. , \" the correct name regardless of the fact that it does not have priority over \" leopoldia . \"\n", "while interspecific hybrids of \" hippeastrum \" are relatively common , hybridization with other genera of amaryllidaceae are more rare . the most conspicuous exception is the hybrid obtained through crossbreeding with the mexican \" sprekelia formosissima \"

( st james 's lily , aztec lily , jacobean lily ) , another member of the tribe hippeastreae , originally called \" amaryllis formosissima , \" which is apomictic . \" \u00d7 hippeastrelia \" is the name given to this cross .\n", "a number of subgenera have been proposed over the years . for instance in the 1870s and 1880s john gilbert baker considerably reorganised \" hippeastrum . \" in 1878 he described nine sections of the genus , but by 1888 he included seven subgenera , namely ( number of species in parentheses ) \" habranthus \" ( 10 ) , \" phycella \" ( 3 ) , \" rhodophiala \" ( 5 ) , \" macropododastrum \" ( 1 ) , \" omphalissa \" ( 6 ) , \" aschamia \" ( 10 ) and \" lais \" ( 3 ) , some of which have since been treated as separate genera ( \" habranthus , \" \" rhodophiala \" ) . baker both reduced the original number of species of herbert , but also enlarged the genus by adding in other genera such as \" habranthus , \" \" phycella , \" \" rhodophiala \" and \" rhodolirion \" ( also called \" rhodolirium , \" and subsequently moved to \" rhodophilia \" ) , which he included as separate sections of \" hippeastrum . \" in addition , he included many new species being discovered in south america , particularly chile . his 1878 classification included 47 species , reduced to 38 by 1888 .\n", "unplaced names include \" hippeastrum ugentii , \" considered in the kew \" world checklist of selected plant families \" as probably a \" crinum . \"\n", "hybrids include \" hippeastrum \u00d7 ' johnsonii \" ' .\n", "\" hippeastrum \" species are concentrated in two centres of diversity , the main one in eastern brazil and the other in the central southern andes of peru , bolivia and argentina , on the eastern slopes and nearby foothills . some species are found as far north as mexico and the west indies . the genus is thought to have originated in brazil where at least 34 of the species have been found . their habitat is mainly tropical and subtropical , though those species found south of the equator , or at sufficient altitude may be considered temperate . \" hippeastrum \" is found in a wide range of habitats . many are found in underbrush , while others prefer full sun . \" hippeastrum angustifolium \" is an example of a species preferring flood areas , while other species prefer a drier habitat . there are also epiphytic species such as \" hippeastrum aulicum , \" \" hippeastrum calyptratum , \" \" hippeastrum papilio \" and \" hippeastrum arboricola , \" which require air circulation around their roots , which are in the subgenus \" omphalissa . \"\n", "species are generally diploid with 2n = 22 chromosomes , but some species , such as \" hippeastrum iguazuanum , \" have 24 . the genus has a degree of interspecies intercompatibility allowing crossing .\n", "some species , such as the uruguayan \" hippeastrum petiolatum , \" are sterile and unable to produce seeds . \" h. petiolatum \" is a sterile triploid that reproduces asexually , producing many bulbils around the mother bulb . these are light , and easily carried on the surface of water ensuring distribution of the species during the rainy season . other species such as \" hippeastrum reticulatum \" are self-pollinating , reproducing by distributing seed . although this does not guarantee genetic diversity in natural populations , it is widely used by colonising species . these two examples are not however typical of the genus , which commonly reproduces through allogamy . one mechanism that limits self-pollination is that of self-incompatibility by which seeds are only produced by pollination from other plants . furthermore , the plant generally releases its pollen about two days before its stigma is receptive , making cross-pollination more likely . pollinators include humming birds in subtropical areas , and moths .\n", "\" hippeastrum \" species are used as food plants by the larvae of some lepidoptera species including \" spodoptera picta \" ( crinum grub ) as well as pseudococcidae ( mealybugs ) , large , and small narcissus bulb flies ( \" eumerus strigatus \" and \" e. funeralis \" ) , thrips , mites , aphids , snails and slugs . a fungal disease attacking \" hippeastrum \" is \" stagonospora curtisii \" ( red blotch , red leaf spot or red fire ) . the leaves are also eaten by grasshoppers , and grasshoppers commonly plant egg pods in the ground near \" hippeastrum \" bulbs , which erupt in the spring , covering the plant with nymphs .\n", "\" hippeastrum \" cultivars and species can be grown inside in pots or outside in warmer climates ( hardiness 7b-11 ) . many will bloom year after year provided they are given a dormant period in a cool , dark place for two months without water or fertilizer although some bulbs will start growing before the two-month period is up .\n", "the bulb is tender and should not be exposed to frost , but is otherwise easy to grow with large rewards for small efforts , especially those that bloom inside during the winter months . note too , that \" hippeastrum \" can also be grown in the ground in temperate areas . bulbs are usually sold in fall for early winter bloom . bare-root bulbs do best planted in a pot only slightly larger than the circumference of the bulb in well-drained , organic mix ( such as sterilized potting soil plus coir fiber , or equal amounts of peat moss , sand and humus ) , with one third of the bulb visible above the surface of the soil and two thirds buried .\n", "\" hippeastrum \" breeding began in 1799 when arthur johnson , a watchmaker in prescot , england , crossed \" hippeastrum reginae \" with \" hippeastrum vitattum , \" obtaining hybrids that were later given the name \" hippeastrum \" \u00d7 ' johnsonii ' ( johnson 's amaryllis , ' hardy amaryllis ' or st. joseph 's lily ) . johnson shared his work with the liverpool botanic garden which was fortunate , since his greenhouse was destroyed in a fire . his hybrid was being cultivated in the us by the mid-nineteenth century . many new hybrid lines followed as new species were sent to europe from south america , the most important of which were \" reginae \" and \" leopoldii . \"\n", "the \" reginae \" strain hybrids were produced by jan de graaff and his two sons in the netherlands in the mid 19th century by crossing \" hippeastrum vitatum \" and \" hippeastrum striatum \" with \" hippeastrum psittacinum \" and some of the better hybrids available in europe at the time . some of the most successful hybrids were \" graveana \" and \" empress of india . \"\n", "\" leopoldii \" hybrids arose from the work of the british explorer and botanist richard pearce , an employee of james veitch & amp ; sons , a plant nursery . pearce brought back specimens of \" hippeastrum leopoldii \" and \" hippeastrum pardinum \" from the andes . these two species were notable for large flowers that were wide open and relatively symmetrical . crossing these two species with the best of the \" reginae \" strain produced a lineage of very large open flowered specimens , with up to 4-6 flowers on each scape . the veitch nursery dominated the commercial development of \" hippeastrum leopoldii \" and other varieties up to the early years of the twentieth century , the best of their hybrids setting the standard for modern commercial development .\n", "in 1946 , two dutch growers moved to south africa and began cultivation there . although most cultivars of \" hippeastrum \" come from the dutch and south african sources , bulbs are now being developed in the united states , japan , israel , india , brazil and australia . the double flowers from japan are particularly beautiful . nurseries may list amaryllis bulbs as being ' dutch ' , ' israeli ' , ' peruvian ' etc . , depending on the country of origin .\n", "three main methods are used for propagating \" hippeastrum \" : seeds , bulbils and ' twin scales ' . more recently micropropagation in vitro has been used on a commercial scale .\n", "the technique of plant tissue culture \" in vitro \" improves the propagation of \" hippeastrum \" by decreasing the time required to reach the minimum size to start the reproductive cycle , using sections of bulbs grown in artificial media with the addition of plant hormones .\n", "\" hippeastrum \" hybrids and cultivars are valued for their large ornamental flowers , particularly for indoor cultivation during the northern hemisphere winter . the larger the bulb , the more flowers it will produce . the largest bulbs measure 14 to 16 inches ( 36 to 41 cm ) in circumference and will produce three or more scapes ( flower stems ) with four or more blooms each . the commonest bulbs measure to inches ( 27 to 32 cm ) with two scapes with four to six flowers each depending on the cultivar . some bulbs put up two flower scapes at the same time ; others may wait several weeks between blooms and sometimes the second scape will have only two or three flowers rather than the usual four . a bulb needs to produce large , healthy leaves in the summer growing season before it can send up a scape the following year . bulbs are often described by the country of origin of the bulb producers , since they may have different characteristics , e.g. ' dutch amaryllis ' , ' south african amarylllis ' . dutch bulbs usually produce flowers first , then , after they have finished blooming ( hysteranthous ) , the plant will begin growing leaves . bulbs from the south african growers usually put up a scape and leaves at the same time ( synanthous ) .\n", "of the commercially available \" hippeastrum \" species , sometimes sold as ' exotic ' amaryllis , \" hippeastrum cybister \" has extremely thin petals often described as spider-like . the miniature evergreen \" hippeastrum papilio \" or \" butterfly amaryllis \" whose petals resemble a butterfly ( papilio ) has a unique color and pattern with broad rose-burgundy center stripes and striations of pale green on the upper petals and narrow stripes on the bottom three . it has been crossed with both cybister and single flower cultivars to produce hybrids with unusual striping .\n", "\" hippeastrum \" bulbs can be induced to rebloom yearly by mimicking the conditions in its natural environment ( cool dry winters ) . when foliage starts to yellow , dormancy can be induced by withholding water and placing the plant in a cool dark place for six to ten weeks or until buds start to show . even when plants are thriving outdoors in temperate climates , dormancy can be induced by withholding watering and fertilising in the northern hemisphere autumn , and bringing indoors to a cool environment prior to the first frost . leaves will usually wither during this period and a flower stem begin to emerge after eight to ten weeks .\n", "cultivars of \" hippeastrum \" are popular indoor ornamental plants prized for their large brightly colored flowers ( including red , pink , salmon , orange and white ) . as such they have a very important place in the floriculture trade for sale as cut flowers or potted plants . although the market is dominated by the netherlands , and south africa , other areas of production include israel , japan and the united states ( florida ) . brazil also produces 17 million \" hippeastrum \" bulbs annually .\n", "\" hippeastrum \" has yielded at least 64 isoquinoline alkaloids , which include anti-parasitic ( e.g. candimine ) and psychopharmacological activity due to their high alkaloid content . one alkaloid isolated from \" hippeastrum vittatum \" ( montanine ) has demonstrated antidepressant , anticonvulsant and anxiolytic properties . \" hippeastrum puniceum \" may also have therapeutic properties as it has been used in folk medicine to treat swellings and wounds .\n", "a stylized flower of a \" hippeastrum \" cultivar ( under its common name of amaryllis ) is used internationally as a symbol for organizations associated with huntington 's disease , a genetic degenerative disease of the nervous system . the widely used logo represents a double image of a head and shoulders as the flower of a growing and vibrant plant . the reduced size of the inner head and shoulders image symbolizes the diminution in a person caused by huntington 's disease . the leaves represent the protection , purpose , growth and development of the huntington 's community worldwide in its search for a cure and treatment .\n", "smith 's paintings included arrangements of flowers consisting of daffodils , hippeastrums and waratahs . as part of her personal oeuvre , she painted a work of a dog sleeping called \" krinkley kronks sleeping \" in cool purples and oranges , although the actual name of the dog was rex .\n", "an additional structure in some plants ( e.g. \" narcissus , \" \" passiflora \" ( passion flower ) , some \" hippeastrum , \" liliaceae ) is the corona ( paraperigonium , paraperigon , or paracorolla ) , a ring or set of appendages of adaxial tissue arising from the corolla or the outer edge of the stamens . it is often positioned where the corolla

some also feature magic altering history all along . one example of a universe that is in part historically recognizable but also obeys different physical laws is poul anderson 's \" three hearts and three lions \" in which the matter of france is history , and the fairy folk are real and powerful . a partly familiar european history for which the author provides a point of divergence is randall garrett 's \" lord darcy \" series : a monk systemizing magic rather than science , so the use of foxglove to treat heart disease is called superstition . the other great point of divergence in this timeline occurs in 1199 , when richard the lionheart survives the siege of chaluz and returns to england , making the angevin empire so strong it survives into the 20th century .\n", "examples of

"cardiac glycosides are a class of organic compounds that increase the output force of the heart and decrease its rate of contractions by acting on the cellular sodium-potassium atpase pump . their beneficial medical uses are as treatments for congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias ; however , their relative toxicity prevents them from being widely used . most commonly found as secondary metabolites in several plants such as foxglove plants , these compounds nevertheless have a diverse range of biochemical effects regarding cardiac cell function and have also been suggested for use in cancer treatment .\n", "cardiac glycosides can be more specifically categorized based on the plant they are derived from , as in the following list . for example , cardenolides have been primarily derived from the foxglove plants \" digitalis purpurea \" and \" digitalis lanata , \" while bufadienolides have been derived from the venom of the cane toad \" bufo marinus , \" from which they receive the \" bufo \" portion of their name . below is a list of organisms from which cardiac glycosides can be derived .\n", "digitalis ( or ) is a genus of about 20 species of herbaceous perennials , shrubs , and biennials commonly called foxgloves .\n", "the best-known species is the common foxglove , \" digitalis purpurea . \" this biennial plant is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its vivid flowers which range in colour from various purple tints through pink , and purely white . the flowers can also possess various marks and spottings . other garden-worthy species include \" d. ferruginea , \" \" d. grandiflora , \" \" d. lutea \" and \" d. parviflora . \"\n", "the term \" digitalis \" is also used for drug preparations that contain cardiac glycosides , particularly one called digoxin , extracted from various plants of this genus . foxglove has medicinal uses but can also be toxic to humans and other animals .\n", "larvae of the foxglove pug , a moth , consume the flowers of the common foxglove for food . other species of lepidoptera eat the leaves , including the lesser yellow underwing .\n", "a group of medicines extracted from foxglove plants are called digitalin . the use of \" d. purpurea \" extract containing cardiac glycosides for the treatment of heart conditions was first described in the english-speaking medical literature by william withering , in 1785 , which is considered the beginning of modern therapeutics . in contemporary medicine digitalis ( usually digoxin ) is obtained from \" d. lanata . \" it is used to increase cardiac contractility ( it is a positive inotrope ) and as an antiarrhythmic agent to control the heart rate , particularly in the irregular ( and often fast ) atrial fibrillation . digitalis is hence often prescribed for patients in atrial fibrillation , especially if they have been diagnosed with congestive heart failure . digoxin was approved for heart failure in 1998 under current regulations by the food and drug administration on the basis of prospective , randomized study and clinical trials . it was also approved for the control of ventricular response rate for patients with atrial fibrillation . american college of cardiology / american heart association guidelines recommend digoxin for symptomatic chronic heart failure for patients with reduced systolic function , preservation of systolic function , and / or rate control for atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response . heart failure society of america guidelines for heart failure provide similar recommendations . despite its relatively recent approval by the food and drug administration and the guideline recommendations , the therapeutic use of digoxin is declining in patients with heart failure - likely the result of several factors . the main factor is the more recent introduction of several drugs shown in randomised controlled studies to improve outcomes in heart failure . safety concerns regarding a proposed link between digoxin therapy and increased mortality seen in observational studies may have contributed to the decline in therapeutic use of digoxin , however a systematic review of 75 studies including four million patient years of patient follow-up showed that in properly designed randomised controlled studies , mortality was no higher in patients given digoxin than in those given placebo .\n", "in some instances , people have confused foxglove with the relatively harmless comfrey ( \" symphytum \" ) plant , which is sometimes brewed into a tea , with fatal consequences . other fatal accidents involve children drinking the water in a vase containing digitalis plants . drying does not reduce the toxicity of the plant . the plant is toxic to

medicine at the university of edinburgh medical school . he worked at birmingham general hospital from 1779 . the story is that he noticed a person with dropsy ( swelling from congestive heart failure ) improve remarkably after taking a traditional herbal remedy ; withering became famous for recognising that the active ingredient in the mixture came from the foxglove plant . the active ingredient is now known as digoxin , after the plant 's scientific name . in 1785 , withering published \" an account of the foxglove and some of its medical uses , \" which contained reports on clinical trials and notes on digitalis 's effects and toxicity .\n", "born in england , withering attended edinburgh medical school from 1762 to 1766 . in 1767 he started as a consultant at stafford royal infirmary . he married helena cookes ( an amateur botanical illustrator , and a former patient of his ) in 1772 ; they had three children ( the first , helena was born in 1775 but died a few days later , william was born in 1776 , and charlotte in 1778 ) . in 1775 he was appointed physician to birmingham general hospital ( at the suggestion of erasmus darwin , a physician and founder member of the lunar society ) , but in 1783 he diagnosed himself as having pulmonary tuberculosis and went twice to portugal hoping the better winter climate would improve his health ; it did not . on the way home from his second trip there , the ship he was in was chased by pirates . in 1785 he was elected a fellow of the prestigious royal society and also published his \" account of the foxglove \" ( see below ) . the following year he leased edgbaston hall , in birmingham . he was one of the members of the lunar society . during the birmingham riots of 1791 ( in which joseph priestley 's home was demolished ) he prepared to flee from edgbaston hall , but his staff kept the rioters at bay until the military arrived . in 1799 he decided that he could not tolerate another winter in the cold and draughty hall , so he bought \" the larches \" in the nearby sparkbrook area ; his wife did not feel up to the move and remained at edgbaston hall . after moving to the larches on 28 september , he died on 6 october 1799 .\n", "allegedly , withering first learned of the use of digitalis in treating \" dropsy \" ( \u0153dema ) from \" mother hutton , \" an old woman who practised as a folk herbalist in shropshire , who used the plant as part of a polyherbal formulation containing over 20 different ingredients to successfully treat this condition . withering deduced that digitalis was the active ingredient in the formulation , and over the ensuing nine years he carefully tried out different preparations of various parts of the plant ( collected in different seasons ) documenting 156 cases where he had employed digitalis , and describing the effects and the best - and safest - way of using it . at least one of these cases was a patient for whom erasmus darwin had asked withering for his second opinion . in january 1785 darwin submitted a paper entitled \" an account of the successful use of foxglove in some dropsies and in pulmonary consumption \" to the college of physicians in london ; it was presented by darwin in march of that year . a postscript at the end of the published volume of transactions containing darwin 's paper states that \" whilst the last pages of this volume were in the press , dr withering of birmingham ... published a numerous collection of cases in which foxglove has been given , and frequently with good success . \" after this , darwin and withering became increasingly estranged , and eventually a argument broke out apparently resulting from robert darwin having accused withering of unprofessional behaviour by effectively poaching patients . this is a very early example of medical academic plagiarism . this was in reality orchestrated by erasmus darwin , a man whose anger and sarcasm when he felt slighted had in all likelihood contributed to the suicide of his own son and later to the estrangement of his son robert .\n", "in reality \" mother hutton \" was created in 1928 in an illustration by william meade prince as part of an advertising campaign by parke-davis who marketed digitalis preparations . there is no mention of a mother hutton in withering 's works or anyone else 's and no mention of him meeting any old woman directly . in his account he states that he is merely asked to comment on a family recipe that was originally an old woman 's receipt or recipe ( that she had long kept secret ) by a colleague . since 1928 , mother hutton 's status has grown from being an image in an advertising poster to an acclaimed wise woman , herbalist , pharmacist and medical practitioner in shropshire who was cheated out of her true recognition by dr. withering 's unscrupulous methods . the story often written around this is also totally apocryphal . withering was in fact informed of the brasenose college , oxford case by one of his medical colleagues dr. ash at birmingham hospital and the dean was treated with digitalis root not leaves . the myth of mother hutton and how withering chased her around shropshire has been created by authors not going back to primary sources but instead copying and then embellishing the unreferenced work of others . see \" withering and the foxglove ; the making of a myth \" by d.m. krikler br heart j 1985 54 : 256-257 . in withering 's \" account of the foxglove \" printed in 1785 withering mentions seven different occasions when foxglove was brought to his attention . recognising that foxglove was the active ingredient in a family recipe ( that was long kept secret by an old woman in shropshire ) would not have been difficult with his expert botanical knowledge . withering had first published his \" botanical arrangement \" in 1776 and in it suggested foxglove deserved looking at in more detail . erasmus darwin tried to take the credit for foxglove and failed . erasmus darwin then attempted to try and discredit withering behind the scenes with the unwitting help of his son robert having earlier used the thesis of his dead son charles to try and establish priority . charles darwin in fact had been friendly with withering ( as had robert ) and had talked in edinburgh university about withering 's experiments with foxglove . erasmus darwin was probably jealous that withering had become the most famous and sought after doctor outside london and that withering 's english botanical arrangement became the standard reference source and far exceeded the botanical publications of erasmus ( all published semi-anonymously ) in popularity . withering 's botanical arrangement , although now almost forgotten , became the standard reference for english botany for almost the next 100 years .\n", "he was buried on 10 october 1799 in edgbaston old church next to edgbaston hall , birmingham , although the exact site of his grave is unknown . the

temperate areas , browsing and grazing is more common early in spring and later becomes more restricted . knowing when plants are ripe for eating is a learned behavior . berries may be foraged in bushes or at the tops of trees , and bears try to maximize the number of berries consumed versus foliage . in autumn , some bear species forage large amounts of naturally fermented fruits , which affects their behavior . smaller bears climb trees to obtain mast ( edible reproductive parts , such as acorns ) . such masts can be very important to the diets of these species , and mast failures may result in long-range movements by bears looking for alternative food sources . brown bears , with their powerful digging abilities , commonly eat roots . the panda 's diet is over 99 % bamboo , of

of water to the roots . in the simplest method , the pot sits in a shallow solution of fertilizer and water or on a capillary mat saturated with nutrient solution . the various hydroponic media available , such as expanded clay and coconut husk , contain more air space than more traditional potting mixes , delivering increased oxygen to the roots , which is important in epiphytic plants such as orchids and bromeliads , whose roots are exposed to the air in nature . additional advantages of passive hydroponics are the reduction of root rot and the additional ambient humidity provided through evaporations .\n", "of these , the orchidaceae , poaceae , cyperaceae , araceae , bromeliaceae , arecaceae , and iridaceae are monocot families ; piperaceae , lauraceae , and annonaceae are

and a few \" seasonings \" like sugarcane and lemongrass . graminoids , especially the grasses , are typically dominant in open ( low moisture but not yet arid , or also fire climax ) habitats like prairie / steppe and savannah and thus form a large proportion of the forage of grazing livestock . possibly due to pastoral nostalgia or simply a desire for open areas for play , they dominate most western yards as lawns , which consume vast sums of money in upkeep ( artificial grazing - mowing - for aesthetics and to keep the allergenic flowers suppressed , irrigation , and fertilizer ) . many bromeliaceae are used as ornamental plants ( and one , the pineapple , is internationally grown in the tropics for fruit ) . many wetland species of sedges , rushes , grasses , and cattails are

"some species of mosquitoes prefer to breed in phytotelmata ( natural reservoirs on plants ) , such as rainwater accumulated in holes in tree trunks , or in the leaf-axils of bromeliads . some specialize in the liquid in pitchers of particular species of pitcher plants , their larvae feeding on decaying insects that had drowned there or on the associated bacteria ; the genus \" wyeomyia \" provides such examples - the harmless \" wyeomyia smithii \" breeds only in the pitchers of \" sarracenia purpurea . \"\n", "in small pools , predators are mostly absent and competition between tadpoles becomes the variable that constrains their survival . certain frog species avoid this competition by making use of smaller phytotelmata ( water-filled leaf axils or small woody cavities ) as sites for depositing a few tadpoles . while these smaller rearing sites are free from competition , they also lack sufficient nutrients to support a tadpole without parental assistance . frog species that changed from the use of larger to smaller phytotelmata have evolved a strategy of providing their offspring with nutritive but unfertilized eggs . the female strawberry poison-dart frog ( \" oophaga pumilio \" ) lays her eggs on the forest floor . the male frog guards them from predation and carries water in his cloaca to keep them moist . when they hatch , the female moves the tadpoles on her back to a water-holding bromeliad or other similar water body , depositing just one in each location . she visits them regularly and feeds them by laying one or two unfertilized eggs in the phytotelma , continuing to do this until the young are large enough to undergo metamorphosis . the granular poison frog ( \" oophaga granulifera \" ) looks after its tadpoles in a similar way .\n", "plant families that originated in the neotropic include bromeliaceae , cannaceae and heliconiaceae .\n", "in agriculture the majority of the biomass produced comes from monocotyledons . these include

such as lilies , daffodils , irises , amaryllis , cannas , bluebells and tulips , are monocotyledons .\n", "thus monocots are distinguishable from other angiosperms both in terms of their uniformity and diversity . on the one hand the organisation of the shoots , leaf structure and floral configuration are more uniform than in the remaining angiosperms , yet within these constraints a wealth of diversity exists , indicating a high degree of evolutionary success . monocot diversity includes perennial geophytes such as ornamental flowers including ( orchids ( asparagales ) , tulips and lilies ) ( liliales ) , rosette and succulent epiphytes ( asparagales ) , mycoheterotrophs ( liliales , dioscoreales , pandanales ) , all in the lilioid monocots , major cereal grains ( maize , rice , barley , rye , oats , millet , sorghum and wheat ) in the grass family and forage grasses ( poales ) as well as woody tree-like palm trees ( arecales ) , bamboo , reeds and bromeliads ( poales ) , bananas and ginger ( zingiberales ) in the commelinid monocots , as well as both emergent ( poales , acorales ) and aroids , as well as floating or submerged aquatic plants such as seagrass ( alismatales ) .\n", "the most important distinction is their growth pattern , lacking a lateral meristem ( cambium ) that allows for continual growth in diameter with height ( secondary growth ) , and therefore this characteristic is a basic limitation in shoot construction . although largely herbaceous , some arboraceous monocots reach great height , length and mass . the latter include agaves , palms , pandans , and bamboos . this creates challenges in water transport that monocots deal with in various ways . some , such as species of \" yucca , \" develop anomalous secondary growth , while palm trees utilise an anomalous primary growth form described as establishment growth ( \" see \" vascular system ) . the axis undergoes primary thickening , that progresses from internode to internode , resulting in a typical inverted conical shape of the basal primary axis ( \" see \" tillich , figure 1 ) . the limited conductivity also contributes to limited branching of the stems . despite these limitations a wide variety of adaptive growth forms has resulted ( tillich , figure 2 ) from epiphytic orchids ( asparagales ) and bromeliads ( poales ) to submarine alismatales ( including the reduced lemnoideae ) and mycotrophic burmanniaceae ( dioscreales ) and triuridaceae ( pandanales ) . other forms of adaptation include the climbing vines of araceae ( alismatales ) which use negative phototropism ( skototropism ) to locate host trees ( \" i.e. \" the darkest area ) , while some palms such as \" calamus manan \" ( arecales ) produce the longest shoots in the plant kingdom , up to 185 m long . other monocots , particularly poales , have adopted a therophyte life form .\n", "historically , bentham ( 1877 ) , considered the monocots to consist of four alliances , epigynae , coronariae , nudiflorae and glumales , based on floral characteristics . he describes the attempts to subdivide the group since the days of lindley as largely unsuccessful . like most subsequent classification systems it failed to distinguish between two major orders , liliales and asparagales , now recognised as quite separate . a major advance in this respect was the work of rolf dahlgren ( 1980 ) , which would form the basis of the angiosperm phylogeny group 's ( apg ) subsequent modern classification of monocot families . dahlgren who used the alternate name lilliidae considered the monocots as a subclass of angiosperms characterised by a single cotyledon and the presence of triangular protein bodies in the sieve tube plastids . he divided the monocots into seven superorders , alismatiflorae , ariflorae , triuridiflorae , liliiflorae , zingiberiflorae , commeliniflorae and areciflorae . with respect to the specific issue regarding liliales and asparagales , dahlgren followed huber ( 1969 ) in adopting a splitter approach , in contrast to the longstanding tendency to view liliaceae as a very broad sensu lato family . following dahlgren 's untimely death in 1987 , his work was continued by his widow , gertrud dahlgren , who published a revised version of the classification in 1989 . in this scheme the suffix \" -florae \" was replaced with \" -anae \" ( \" e.g. \" alismatanae ) and the number of superorders expanded to ten with the addition of bromelianae , cyclanthanae and pandananae .\n", "the pineapple ( \" ananas comosus \" ) is a tropical plant with an edible fruit and the most economically significant plant in the family bromeliaceae . the pineapple is indigenous to south america , where it has been cultivated for many centuries . the introduction of the pineapple to europe in the 17th century made it a significant cultural icon of luxury . since the 1820s , pineapple has been commercially grown in greenhouses and many tropical plantations . further , it is the third most important tropical fruit in world production . in the 20th century , hawaii was a dominant producer of pineapples , especially for the us ; however , by 2016 , costa rica , brazil , and the philippines accounted for nearly one-third of the world 's production of pineapples .\n", "an epiphyte is an organism that grows on the surface of a plant and derives its moisture and nutrients from the air , rain , water ( in marine environments ) or from debris accumulating around it . epiphytes take part in nutrient cycles and add to both the diversity and biomass of the ecosystem in which they occur , like any other organism . they are an important source of food for many species . typically , the older parts of a plant will have more epiphytes growing on them . epiphytes differ from parasites in that they grow on other plants for physical support and do not necessarily affect the host negatively . an organism that grows on another organism that is not a plant may be called an epibiont . epiphytes are usually found in the temperate zone ( e.g. , many mosses , liverworts , lichens , and algae ) or in the tropics ( e.g. , many ferns , cacti , orchids , and bromeliads ) . epiphyte species make good houseplants due to their minimal water and soil requirements . epiphytes provide a rich and diverse habitat for other organisms including animals , fungi , bacteria , and myxomycetes .\n", "the best-known epiphytic plants include mosses , orchids , and bromeliads such as spanish moss ( of the genus \" tillandsia \" ) , but epiphytes may be found in

forests of central and south america , in southern united states from southern virginia to florida to texas , and in far southern arizona .\n", "bromeliads often serve as phytotelmata , accumulating water between their leaves . the aquatic habitat created as a result is host to a diverse array of invertebrates , especially aquatic insect larvae . these bromeliad invertebrates benefit their hosts by increasing nitrogen uptake into the plant .\n", "trees or branches that have a higher incidence of sunlight tend to have more bromeliads . in contrast , the sectors facing west receive less sunlight and therefore fewer bromeliads . in addition , thicker trees have more bromeliads , possibly because they are older and have greater structural complexity .\n", "bromeliads are among the more recent plant groups to have emerged . the greatest number of primitive species resides in the andean highlands of south america , where they originated in the tepuis of the guiana shield approximately 100 million years ago . however , the family did not diverge into its extant subfamilies until 19 million years ago . the long period between the origin and diversification of bromeliads , during which no extant species evolved , suggests that there was much speciation and extinction during that time , which would explain the genetic distance of the bromeliaceae from other families within the poales . the most basal genus , \" brocchinia , \" is endemic to the guiana shield , and is placed as the sister group to the remaining genera in the family . the subfamilies navioideae and lindmanioideae are endemic to the guiana shield as well .\n", "the west african species \" pitcairnia feliciana \" is the only bromeliad not endemic to the americas , and is thought to have reached africa via long-distance dispersal about 12 million years ago .\n", "around 5.5 million years ago , a clade of epiphytic bromelioids arose in serra do mar , a lush mountainous region on the coast of southeastern brazil . this is thought to have been caused not only by the uplift of serra do mar itself at that time , but also because of the continued uplift of the distant andes mountains , which impacted the circulation of air and created a cooler , wetter climate in serra do mar. these epiphytes thrived in this humid environment , since their trichomes rely on water in the air rather than from the ground like terrestrial plants . many epiphytic bromeliads with the tank habit also speciated here .\n", "even before this , a few other bromeliads had already dispersed to the brazilian shield while the climate was still arid , likely through a gradual process of short-distance dispersal . these make up the terrestrial members of the bromelioideae , which have highly xeromorphic characters .\n", "bromeliads are able to live in a vast array of environmental conditions due to their many adaptations . trichomes , in the form of scales or hairs , allow bromeliads to capture water in cloud forests and help to reflect sunlight in desert environments . some bromeliads have also developed an adaptation known as the tank habit , which involves them forming a tightly bound structure with their leaves that helps to capture water and nutrients in the absence of a well-developed root system . bromeliads also use crassulacean acid metabolism ( cam ) photosynthesis to create sugars . this adaptation allows bromeliads in hot or dry climates to open their stomates at night rather than during the very day , which reduces water loss .\n", "the family bromeliaceae is currently placed in the order poales .\n", "the family bromeliaceae is organized into eight subfamilies :\n", "bromeliaceae were originally split into three subfamilies based on morphological seed characters : bromelioideae ( seeds in baccate fruits ) , tillandsioideae ( plumose seeds ) , and pitcairnioideae ( seeds with wing-like appendages ) . however , molecular evidence has revealed that while bromelioideae and tillandsioideae are monophyletic , pitcairnioideae is , in fact , paraphyletic and should be split into six subfamilies : brocchinioideae , lindmanioideae , hechtioideae , navioideae , pitcairnioideae , and puyoideae .\n", "brocchinioideae is defined as the most basal branch of bromeliaceae based on both morphological and molecular evidence , namely genes in chloroplast dna .\n", "humans have been using bromeliads for thousands of years . the incas , aztecs , maya and others used them for food , protection , fiber and ceremony , just as they are still used today . european interest began when spanish conquistadors returned with pineapple , which became so popular as an exotic food that the image of the pineapple was adapted into european art and sculpture . in 1776 , the species \" guzmania lingulata \" was introduced to europe , causing a sensation among gardeners unfamiliar with such a plant . in 1828 , \" aechmea fasciata \" was brought to europe , followed by \" vriesea splendens \" in 1840 . these transplants were so successful , they are still among the most widely grown bromeliad varieties .\n", "in the 19th century , breeders in belgium , france and the netherlands started hybridizing plants for wholesale trade . many exotic varieties were produced until world war i , which halted breeding programs and led to the loss of some species . the plants experienced a resurgence of popularity after world war ii . since then , dutch , belgian and north american nurseries have greatly expanded bromeliad production .\n", "only one bromeliad , the pineapple ( \" ananas comosus \" ) , is a commercially important food crop . bromelain , a common ingredient in meat tenderizer , is extracted from pineapple stems . many other bromeliads are popular ornamental plants , grown as both garden and houseplants .\n", "bromeliads are important food plants for many peoples . for example , the pima of mexico occasionally consume flowers of \" tillandsia erubescens \" and \" t. recurvata \" due to their high sugar content ; in argentina and bolivia , the shoot apices of \" t. rubella \" and \" t. maxima \" are consumed ; in venezuela , indigenous coastal tribes eat a sour-tasting but sweet-smelling berry , known as ' maya ' , of \" bromelia chrysantha \" as a fruit or in fermented beverages .\n", "edouard andre was a french collector / explorer whose many discoveries of bromeliads in the cordilleras of south america would be influential on horticulturists to follow . he served as a source of inspiration to 20th-century collectors , in particular mulford b. foster and lyman smith of the united states and werner rauh of germany and michelle jenkins of australia .\n"]}
