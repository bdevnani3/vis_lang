forms as large-flowered garden plants", " Cannas are also used in agriculture as a source of starch for human and animal consumption", "Although plants of the tropics, most cultivars have been developed in temperate climates and are easy to grow in most countries of the world, as long as they receive at least 68 hours average sunlight during the summer, and are moved to a warm location for

Herbert, means \"knight's star\", although precisely what Herbert meant by the name is not certain", " For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names Amaryllis and Hippeastrum, one result of which is that the common name amaryllis is mainly used for cultivars of this genus, often sold as indoor flowering bulbs particularly at Christmas in the northern hemisphere", " By contrast the generic name Amaryllis applies to bulbs from South Africa, usually grown outdoors", " The genus is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas from Argentina north to Mexico and the Caribbean", "\nReproduction is generally by allogamy (cross-pollination) and Hippeastrum may be propagated by seed or offset bulbils (bulblets), although commercial

collects on its leaves", " It obtains nitrogen from bacteria, and other minerals largely from blown dust", " Though not a harmful parasite in the same sense as plants such as mistletoes that feed on the sap of the host, ball moss may compete with a host tree for sunlight and some nutrients, and by restricting available surface area for new branch sprouts; however, except on stressed host trees

that T", " recurvata is capable of dispersal through animal-mediated vectors, such as epizoochory or endozoochory", " Mature seeds have no apparent adhesive on the exterior, and very little nutrient supply to support sprouting, but, like many other epiphyte seeds, they are borne plentifully and are armed with fine, straight hairs that could well adhere to wet or clinging surfaces, such as rough bark, which would provide enough time for the seedlings to anchor themselves with their roots", " In fact, as shown in the accompanying photograph, they even grow plentifully on fences and telephone
