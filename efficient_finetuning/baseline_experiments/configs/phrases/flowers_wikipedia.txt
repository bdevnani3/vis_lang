'A {}, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms)'
' The biological function of a {} is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs'
' Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) resulting from cross pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same {}) when self-pollination occurs'
' Self-pollination happens when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same {}, or another flower on the same plant'
' Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one {} to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species'
' Self-pollination happens in {}s where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma'
'Some {}s produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy)'
' Many {}s have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen'
' After fertilization, the ovary of the {} develops into fruit containing seeds'
'In addition to facilitating the reproduction of {}ing plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to bring beauty to their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food'
' It comes originally from the Latin name of the Italian goddess of {}s, Flora'
' The early word for {} in English was blossom, though it now refers to flowers only of fruit trees'
'The essential parts of a {} can be considered in two parts: the vegetative part, consisting of petals and associated structures in the perianth, and the reproductive or sexual parts'
' A stereotypical {} consists of four kinds of structures attached to the tip of a short stalk'
' The four main whorls (starting from the base of the {} or lowest node and working upwards) are as follows: Perianth Collectively the calyx and corolla form the perianth (see diagram)'
'Calyx: the outermost whorl consisting of units called sepals; these are typically green and enclose the rest of the {} in the bud stage, however, they can be absent or prominent and petal-like in some species'
'Gynoecium (from Greek gynaikos oikia: woman's house): the innermost whorl of a {}, consisting of one or more units called carpels'
' The gynoecium of a {} is also described using an alternative terminology wherein the structure one sees in the innermost whorl (consisting of an ovary, style and stigma) is called a pistil'
' These modifications have significance in the evolution of {}ing plants and are used extensively by botanists to establish relationships among plant species'
'The four main parts of a {} are generally defined by their positions on the receptacle and not by their function'
' Many {}s lack some parts or parts may be modified into other functions and/or look like what is typically another part'
' Other {}s have modified stamens that are petal-like; the double flowers of Peonies and Roses are mostly petaloid stamens'
'Specific terminology is used to describe {}s and their parts'
' Many {} parts are fused together; fused parts originating from the same whorl are connate, while fused parts originating from different whorls are adnate; parts that are not fused are free'
' A sympetalous {}, with bilateral symmetry with an upper and lower lip, is bilabiate'
'Many {}s have a symmetry'
' When the perianth is bisected through the central axis from any point and symmetrical halves are produced, the {} is said to be actinomorphic or regular, e'
' When {}s are bisected and produce only one line that produces symmetrical halves, the flower is said to be irregular or zygomorphic, e'
' The stem or stalk subtending a {} is called a peduncle'
' If a peduncle supports more than one {}, the stems connecting each flower to the main axis are called pedicels'
' The apex of a {}ing stem forms a terminal swelling which is called the torus or receptacle'
' Inflorescence In those species that have more than one {} on an axis, the collective cluster of flowers is termed an inflorescence'
' Some inflorescences are composed of many small {}s arranged in a formation that resembles a single flower'
' A single daisy or sun{}, for example, is not a flower but a flower head—an inflorescence composed of numerous flowers (or florets)'
' Floral diagrams and floral formulae A floral formula is a way to represent the structure of a {} using specific letters, numbers and symbols, presenting substantial information about the flower in a compact form'
'The structure of a {} can also be expressed by the means of floral diagrams'
' Such diagrams may show important features of {}s, including the relative positions of the various organs, including the presence of fusion and symmetry, as well as structural details'
'A {} develops on a modified shoot or axis from a determinate apical meristem (determinate meaning the axis grows to a set size)'
' Taking into account the whole diversity in the development of the androecium of {}ing plants, we find a continuum between modified leaves (phyllomes), modified stems (caulomes), and modified branchlets (shoots)'
'The transition to {}ing is one of the major phase changes that a plant makes during its life cycle'
' Many perennial and most biennial plants require vernalization to {}'
' Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop {}s, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue'
'The ABC model is a simple model that describes the genes responsible for the development of {}s'
' In the third whorl, B and C genes interact to form stamens and in the center of the {} C genes alone give rise to carpels'
' The model is based upon studies of aberrant {}s and mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana and the snapdragon, Antirrhinum majus'
' For example, when there is a loss of B gene function, mutant {}s are produced with sepals in the first whorl as usual, but also in the second whorl instead of the normal petal formation'
'The principal purpose of a {} is the reproduction of the individual and the species'
' All {}ing plants are heterosporous, that is, every individual plant produces two types of spores'
'In the majority of plant species, individual {}s have both functional carpels and stamens'
' Botanists describe these {}s as "perfect" or "bisexual", and the species as "hermaphroditic"'
' In a minority of plant species, their {}s lack one or the other reproductive organ and are described as "imperfect" or "unisexual"'
' If the individual plants of a species each have unisexual {}s of both sexes then the species is "monoecious"'
' Alternatively, if each individual plant has only unisexual {}s of the same sex then the species is "dioecious"'
'The primary purpose of the {} is reproduction'
' Since the {}s are the reproductive organs of the plant, they mediate the joining of the sperm, contained within pollen, to the ovules — contained in the ovary'
' Many {}s are dependent, then, upon external factors for pollination, such as: the wind, water, animals, and especially insects'
' To accomplish this, {}s have specific designs which encourage the transfer of pollen from one plant to another of the same species'
' The period of time during which this process can take place (when the {} is fully expanded and functional) is called anthesis, hence the study of pollination biology is called anthecology'
'Flowering plants usually face evolutionary pressure to optimize the transfer of their pollen, and this is typically reflected in the morphology of the {}s and the behaviour of the plants'
' Around 80% of {}ing plants make use of biotic, or living vectors'
'Though some fit between or outside of these groups, most {}s can be divided between the following two broad groups of pollination methods:Flowers that use biotic vectors attract and use insects, bats, birds or other animals to transfer pollen from one flower to the next'
' In pursuing this attractant from many {}s of the same species, the pollinator transfers pollen to the stigmas—arranged with equally pointed precision—of all of the flowers it visits'
' Many {}s rely on simple proximity between flower parts to ensure pollination, while others have elaborate designs to ensure pollination and prevent self-pollination'
' Attraction methods Plants cannot move from one location to another, thus many {}s have evolved to attract animals to transfer pollen between individuals in dispersed populations'
' Most commonly, {}s are insect-pollinated, known as entomophilous; literally "insect-loving" in Greek'
' To attract these insects {}s commonly have glands called nectaries on various parts that attract animals looking for nutritious nectar'
' Birds and bees have color vision, enabling them to seek out "colorful" {}s'
' Some {}s have patterns, called nectar guides, that show pollinators where to look for nectar; they may be visible only under ultraviolet light, which is visible to bees and some other insects'
'Flowers also attract pollinators by scent, thought not all {} scents are appealing to humans; a number of flowers are pollinated by insects that are attracted to rotten flesh and have flowers that smell like dead animals'
' These are often called Carrion {}s, including plants in the genus Rafflesia, and the titan arum'
' Flowers pollinated by night visitors, including bats and moths, are likely to concentrate on scent to attract pollinators and so most such {}s are white'
' Other {}s use mimicry or pseudocopulation to attract pollinators'
' Many orchids for example, produce {}s resembling female bees or wasps in colour, shape, and scent'
' Males move from one {} to the next in search of a mate, pollinating the flowers'
' Flower-pollinator relationships Many {}s have close relationships with one or a few specific pollinating organisms'
' Many {}s, for example, attract only one specific species of insect, and therefore rely on that insect for successful reproduction'
' This close relationship an example of coevolution, as the {} and pollinator have developed together over a long period of time to match each other's needs'
'Flowers that use abiotic, or non-living, vectors use the wind or, much less commonly, water, to move pollen from one {} to the next'
' In wind-dispersed (anemophilous) species, the tiny pollen grains are carried, sometimes many thousands of kilometres, by the wind to other {}s'
' They have no need to attract pollinators and therefore tend not to grow large, showy, or colorful {}s, and do not have nectaries, nor a noticeable scent'
' Because of this, plants typically have many thousands of tiny {}s which have comparatively large, feathery stigmas; to increase the chance of pollen being received'
' Whereas the pollen of entomophilous {}s is usually large, sticky, and rich in protein (to act as a "reward" for pollinators), anemophilous flower pollen is typically small-grained, very light, smooth, and of little nutritional value to insects'
' In order for the wind to effectively pick up and transport the pollen, the {}s typically have anthers loosely attached to the end of long thin filaments, or pollen forms around a catkin which moves in the wind'
' Rarer forms of this involve individual {}s being moveable by the wind (Pendulous), or even less commonly; the anthers exploding to release the pollen into the wind'
'Pollination through water (hydrophily) is a much rarer method, occurring in only around 2% of abiotically-pollinated {}s'
' Marine {}s have floating thread-like stigmas and may have adaptations for the tide, while freshwater species create indentations in the water'
' The third category, set out by Schwarzenbach, is those {}s which transport pollen above the water through conveyance'
' This ranges from floating plants, (Lemnoideae), to staminate {}s (Vallisneria)'
' Most species in this group have dry, spherical pollen which sometimes forms into larger masses, and female {}s which form depressions in the water; the method of transport varies'
' Cross-pollination, therefore, increases the survival of the species and is usually preferred by {}s for this reason'
' Self-pollination Self-pollination is the pollination of the carpel of a {} by pollen from either the same flower or another flower on the same plant, leading to the creation of a genetic clone through asexual reproduction'
' The extreme case of self-fertilization, when the ovule is fertilized by pollen from the same {} or plant, occurs in flowers that always self-fertilize, such as many dandelions'
' Some {}s are self-pollinated and have flowers that never open or are self-pollinated before the flowers open; these flowers are called cleistogamous; many species in the genus Viola exhibit this, for example'
' Unisexual male and female {}s on the same plant may not appear or mature at the same time, or pollen from the same plant may be incapable of fertilizing its ovules'
' The latter {} types, which have chemical barriers to their own pollen, are referred to as self-incompatible'
' If no pollinators visit, however, then the stigmatic covering falls off naturally to allow for the {}'s own anthers to pollinate the flower through self-pollination'
' The protection became the seed, though it had not yet evolved the {}'
'Several groups of extinct gymnosperms, particularly seed ferns, have been proposed as the ancestors of {}ing plants but there is no continuous fossil evidence showing exactly how flowers evolved'
' The apparently sudden appearance of relatively modern {}s in the fossil record posed such a problem for the theory of evolution that it was called an "abominable mystery" by Charles Darwin'
' An early fossil of a {}ing plant, Archaefructus liaoningensis from China, is dated about 125 million years old'
'  In 2018, scientists reported that the earliest {}s began about 180 million years ago'
'Besides the hard proof of {}s in or shortly before the Cretaceous, there is some circumstantial evidence of flowers as much as 250 million years ago'
'The similarity in leaf and stem structure can be very important, because {}s are genetically just an adaptation of normal leaf and stem components on plants, a combination of genes normally responsible for forming new shoots'
' The most primitive {}s are thought to have had a variable number of flower parts, often separate from (but in contact with) each other'
' The {}s would have tended to grow in a spiral pattern, to be bisexual (in plants, this means both male and female parts on the same flower), and to be dominated by the ovary (female part)'
' As {}s grew more advanced, some variations developed parts fused together, with a much more specific number and design, and with either specific sexes per flower or plant, or at least "ovary inferior"'
'The general assumption is that the function of {}s, from the start, was to involve animals in the reproduction process'
'Likewise, most fruit used in plant reproduction comes from the enlargement of parts of the {}'
'While many such symbiotic relationships remain too fragile to survive competition with mainland organisms, {}s proved to be an unusually effective means of production, spreading (whatever their actual origin) to become the dominant form of land plant life'
'Flower evolution continues to the present day; modern {}s have been so profoundly influenced by humans that many of them cannot be pollinated in nature'
' Many modern, domesticated {}s used to be simple weeds, which only sprouted when the ground was disturbed'
'Many {}ing plants reflect as much light as possible within the range of visible wavelengths of the pollinator the plant intends to attract'
' An important feature of white {}s is that they reflect equally across the visible spectrum'
' While many {}ing plants use white to attract pollinators, the use of color is also widespread (even within the same species)'
' Color allows a {}ing plant to be more specific about the pollinator it seeks to attract'
' If it is assumed that the visual systems of most pollinators view the visible spectrum as circular then it may be said that {}ing plants produce color by absorbing the light in one region of the spectrum and reflecting the light in the other region'
' Most {}s absorb light in the blue to yellow region of the spectrum and reflect light from the green to red region of the spectrum'
' For many species of {}ing plant, it is the transition point that characterizes the color that they produce'
' Color may be modulated by shifting the transition point between absorption and reflection and in this way a {}ing plant may specify which pollinator it seeks to attract'
'Some {}ing plants also have a limited ability to modulate areas of absorption'
'Many {}s have important symbolic meanings in Western culture'
' The practice of assigning meanings to {}s is known as floriography'
'Because of their varied and colorful appearance, {}s have long been a favorite subject of visual artists as well'
' Some of the most celebrated paintings from well-known painters are of {}s, such as Van Gogh's sunflowers series or Monet's water lilies'
' Many cultures around the world have a marked tendency to associate {}s with femininity'
'The great variety of delicate and beautiful {}s has inspired the works of numerous poets, especially from the 18th–19th century Romantic era'
'The Roman goddess of {}s, gardens, and the season of Spring is Flora'
' The Greek goddess of spring, {}s and nature is Chloris'
'In Hindu mythology, {}s have a significant status'
' Vishnu, one of the three major gods in the Hindu system, is often depicted standing straight on a lotus {}'
'In modern times, people have sought ways to cultivate, buy, wear, or otherwise be around {}s and blooming plants, partly because of their agreeable appearance and smell'
' In Christianity, chancel {}s often adorn churches'
' In Hindu culture, adherents commonly bring {}s as a gift to templesPeople therefore grow flowers around their homes, dedicate parts of their living space to flower gardens, pick wildflowers, or buy commercially-grown flowers from florists'
' Flower vegetables include broccoli, cauli{} and artichoke'
' Other {} spices are cloves and capers'
' Hops {}s are used to flavor beer'
' Marigold {}s are fed to chickens to give their egg yolks a golden yellow color, which consumers find more desirable; dried and ground marigold flowers are also used as a spice and colouring agent in Georgian cuisine'
' Honey consists of bee-processed {} nectar and is often named for the type of flower, e'
'Hundreds of fresh {}s are edible, but only few are widely marketed as food'
' Some edible {}s include nasturtium, chrysanthemum, carnation, cattail, Japanese honeysuckle, chicory, cornflower, canna, and sunflower'
' Edible {}s such as daisy, rose, and violet are sometimes candied'
' Many cultures draw a connection between {}s and life and death, and because of their seasonal return flowers also suggest rebirth, which may explain why many people place flowers upon graves'
' The ancient Greeks, as recorded in Euripides's play The Phoenician Women,  placed a crown of {}s on the head of the deceased; they also covered tombs with wreaths and flower petals'
' Flowers were widely used in ancient Egyptian burials, and the Mexicans to this day use {}s prominently in their Day of the Dead celebrations in the same way that their Aztec ancestors did'
'The {}-giving tradition goes back to prehistoric times when flowers often had a medicinal and herbal attributes'
' Archaeologists found in several grave sites remnants of {} petals'
' Ancient Egyptians and later Greeks and Romans used {}s'
' In Egypt, burial objects from the time around 1540 BC were found, which depicted red poppy, yellow Araun, corn{} and lilies'
' Records of {} giving appear in Chinese writings and Egyptian hieroglyphics, as well as in Greek and Roman mythology'
' The practice of giving a {} flourished in the Middle Ages when couples showed affection through flowers'
'The tradition of {}-giving exists in many forms'
' It is common for students to give {}s to their teachers'
' To give yellow {}s in a romantic relationship means break-up in Russia'
' Nowadays, {}s are often given away in the form of a flower bouquet'
